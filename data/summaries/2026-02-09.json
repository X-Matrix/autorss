Users were prompting Grok, the platform’s built-in AI\nfeature, to “nudify” women’s images. Mayes, a 25-year-old media\nprofessional from Texas who uses X to post photos with her friends\nand keep up with news, didn’t think it would happen to her — until it did.</p>\n\n<p>“Put her in a tight clear transparent bikini,” an X user ordered\nthe bot under a photo that Mayes posted from when she was 20. Grok\ncomplied, replacing her white shirt with a clear bikini top. The\nwaistband of her jeans and black belt dissolved into thin,\ntranslucent strings. The see-through top made the upper half of\nher body look realistically naked.</p>\n\n<p>Hiding behind an anonymous profile, the user’s page was filled\nwith similar images of women, digitally and nonconsensually\naltered and sexualized. Mayes wanted to cuss the faceless user\nout, but decided to simply block the account. She hoped that would\nbe the end of it. Soon, however, her comments became littered with\nmore images of herself in clear bikinis and skin-tight latex\nbodysuits. Mayes says that all of the requests came from anonymous\nprofiles that also targeted other women. Though some users have\nhad their accounts suspended, as of publication, some of the\nimages of Mayes are still up on X.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Emma, a content creator, was at the grocery store when she saw the\nnotifications of people asking Grok to undress her images. [...]\nNumbness washed over Emma when the images finally loaded on her\ntimeline. A selfie of her holding a cat had been transformed into\na nude. The cat was removed from the photo, Emma says, and her\nupper body was made naked.</p>\n\n<p>Emma immediately made her account private and reported the images.\nIn an email response reviewed by Rolling Stone, X User Support\nasked her to upload an image of her government-issued ID so they\ncould look into the report, but Emma responded that she didn’t\nfeel comfortable doing so. [...] In our call, she checked to see\nif some of the image edits she was aware of were still up on X.\nThey were. “Oh, my God,” she says, letting out a defeated sigh.\n“It has 15,000 views. Oh, that’s so sad.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This fun app is available, free of charge, on the App Store, which means you know it’s safe and approved by Apple.

Users were prompting Grok, the platform’s built-in AI\nfeature, to “nudify” women’s images. Mayes, a 25-year-old media\nprofessional from Texas who uses X to post photos with her friends\nand keep up with news, didn’t think it would happen to her — until it did.</p>\n\n<p>“Put her in a tight clear transparent bikini,” an X user ordered\nthe bot under a photo that Mayes posted from when she was 20. Grok\ncomplied, replacing her white shirt with a clear bikini top. The\nwaistband of her jeans and black belt dissolved into thin,\ntranslucent strings. The see-through top made the upper half of\nher body look realistically naked.</p>\n\n<p>Hiding behind an anonymous profile, the user’s page was filled\nwith similar images of women, digitally and nonconsensually\naltered and sexualized. Mayes wanted to cuss the faceless user\nout, but decided to simply block the account. She hoped that would\nbe the end of it. Soon, however, her comments became littered with\nmore images of herself in clear bikinis and skin-tight latex\nbodysuits. Mayes says that all of the requests came from anonymous\nprofiles that also targeted other women. Though some users have\nhad their accounts suspended, as of publication, some of the\nimages of Mayes are still up on X.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Emma, a content creator, was at the grocery store when she saw the\nnotifications of people asking Grok to undress her images. [...]\nNumbness washed over Emma when the images finally loaded on her\ntimeline. A selfie of her holding a cat had been transformed into\na nude. The cat was removed from the photo, Emma says, and her\nupper body was made naked.</p>\n\n<p>Emma immediately made her account private and reported the images.\nIn an email response reviewed by Rolling Stone, X User Support\nasked her to upload an image of her government-issued ID so they\ncould look into the report, but Emma responded that she didn’t\nfeel comfortable doing so. [...] In our call, she checked to see\nif some of the image edits she was aware of were still up on X.\nThey were. “Oh, my God,” she says, letting out a defeated sigh.\n“It has 15,000 views. Oh, that’s so sad.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This fun app is available, free of charge, on the App Store, which means you know it’s safe and approved by Apple.

For years, Stickies’s popularity\nconfounded me. Why would anyone use a note-taking utility that\nrequires you to leave every saved note open in its own window on\nscreen? The more you use it, the more cluttered it gets. But\nhere’s the thing: cluttered though it may be, <em>you never have to\nsave anything in Stickies</em>. Switch to Stickies, Command-N, type\nyour new note, and you’re done. (And, yes, if you create a new\nsticky note, then force-quit Stickies, the note you just created\nwill be there when next you launch the app. Stickies’s auto-save\nhappens while you type, not just at quit time.) It feels easy and\nit feels safe. Stickies does not offer a good long-term storage\ndesign, but it offers a frictionless short-term\njot-something-down-right-now design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here we are in 2026, 17 years later, and, unsurprisingly, some things have changed. Apple Notes didn’t get a Mac version until Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in 2012. And Apple Notes didn’t really get <em>good</em> until 2016 or 2017. I still use Yojimbo, the library-based Mac app I wrote about in the above piece in 2009, but I don’t use it nearly as much as I used to. I use Apple Notes instead, for most notes, because it has good clients for iPhone and iPad (and Vision Pro and even Apple Watch).</p>\n\n<p>Other things, however, have not changed since 2009. Like the Stickies app, which is still around in MacOS 26 Tahoe, largely unchanged, except for <a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/2025/11/05/tahoes-terrible-icons/#:~:text=STICKIES\">a sad Liquid Glass-style icon</a>. If you still use Stickies, you should consider moving to Apple Notes. There’s even a command (File → Export All to Notes...) to import all your notes from Stickies into Apple Notes, with subfolders in Notes for each color sticky note. Apple Notes on the Mac even supports one of Stickies’s signature features: the Window → Float on Top command will keep a note’s window floating atop the windows from other apps even when Apple Notes is in the background.</p>\n\n<p>(Stickies has another cool feature that no other current app I know of does: it still supports “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WindowShade\">window shading</a>”. Double-click the title bar of a note in Stickies and the rest of the window will “roll up”, leaving only the title bar behind. Double-click again and it rolls down. This was a built-in feature for all windows in all apps on classic Mac OS, starting with Mac OS 8, but was replaced in favor of minimizing windows into the Dock with Mac OS X. Window shading was a better feature (and could have been kept <em>alongside</em> minimizing into the Dock).

For years, Stickies’s popularity\nconfounded me. Why would anyone use a note-taking utility that\nrequires you to leave every saved note open in its own window on\nscreen? The more you use it, the more cluttered it gets. But\nhere’s the thing: cluttered though it may be, <em>you never have to\nsave anything in Stickies</em>. Switch to Stickies, Command-N, type\nyour new note, and you’re done. (And, yes, if you create a new\nsticky note, then force-quit Stickies, the note you just created\nwill be there when next you launch the app. Stickies’s auto-save\nhappens while you type, not just at quit time.) It feels easy and\nit feels safe. Stickies does not offer a good long-term storage\ndesign, but it offers a frictionless short-term\njot-something-down-right-now design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here we are in 2026, 17 years later, and, unsurprisingly, some things have changed. Apple Notes didn’t get a Mac version until Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in 2012. And Apple Notes didn’t really get <em>good</em> until 2016 or 2017. I still use Yojimbo, the library-based Mac app I wrote about in the above piece in 2009, but I don’t use it nearly as much as I used to. I use Apple Notes instead, for most notes, because it has good clients for iPhone and iPad (and Vision Pro and even Apple Watch).</p>\n\n<p>Other things, however, have not changed since 2009. Like the Stickies app, which is still around in MacOS 26 Tahoe, largely unchanged, except for <a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/2025/11/05/tahoes-terrible-icons/#:~:text=STICKIES\">a sad Liquid Glass-style icon</a>. If you still use Stickies, you should consider moving to Apple Notes. There’s even a command (File → Export All to Notes...) to import all your notes from Stickies into Apple Notes, with subfolders in Notes for each color sticky note. Apple Notes on the Mac even supports one of Stickies’s signature features: the Window → Float on Top command will keep a note’s window floating atop the windows from other apps even when Apple Notes is in the background.</p>\n\n<p>(Stickies has another cool feature that no other current app I know of does: it still supports “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WindowShade\">window shading</a>”. Double-click the title bar of a note in Stickies and the rest of the window will “roll up”, leaving only the title bar behind. Double-click again and it rolls down. This was a built-in feature for all windows in all apps on classic Mac OS, starting with Mac OS 8, but was replaced in favor of minimizing windows into the Dock with Mac OS X. Window shading was a better feature (and could have been kept <em>alongside</em> minimizing into the Dock). With the Stickies app, window shading works particularly well with the aforementioned Float on Top feature — you can keep a floating window available, atop all other windows, but while it’s rolled up it hardly takes up any space or obscures anything underneath.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/26/from-the-df-archive-untitled-document-syndrome\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘From the DF Archive: ‘Untitled Document Syndrome’’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",

Apple computers have come with text-editing software\nsince the original Mac was released, in 1984; the current\niteration of the program launched in the mid-nineties and has\nsurvived relatively unchanged. Over the past few years, I’ve found\nmyself relying on TextEdit more as every other app has grown more\ncomplicated, adding cloud uploads, collaborative editing, and now\ngenerative A.I. TextEdit is not connected to the internet, like\nGoogle Docs. It is not part of a larger suite of workplace\nsoftware, like Microsoft Word. You can write in TextEdit, and you\ncan format your writing with a bare minimum of fonts and styling.\nThose files are stored as RTFs (short for rich-text format), one\nstep up from the most basic TXT file. TextEdit now functions as my\nto-do-list app, my e-mail drafting window, my personal calendar,\nand my stash of notes to self, which act like digital Post-its.</p>\n\n<p>I trust in TextEdit. It doesn’t redesign its interface without\nwarning, the way Spotify does; it doesn’t hawk new features, and\nit doesn’t demand I update the app every other week, as Google\nChrome does. I’ve tried out other software for keeping track of my\nrandom thoughts and ideas in progress — the personal note-storage\napp Evernote; the task-management board Trello; the collaborative\ndigital workspace Notion, which can store and share company\ninformation. Each encourages you to adapt to a certain philosophy\nof organization, with its own formats and filing systems. But\nnothing has served me better than the brute simplicity of\nTextEdit, which doesn’t try to help you at all with the process of\nthinking. Using the app is the closest you can get to writing\nlonghand on a screen. I could make lists on actual paper, of\ncourse, but I’ve also found that my brain has been so irredeemably\nwarped by keyboards that I can only really get my thoughts down by\ntyping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Old habits are hard to break. And trust me, I, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">of all people</a>, know the value of writing stuff — all sorts of stuff — in plain text files. (RTF isn’t plain text, but it is a stable and standard format.) I’ve been using BBEdit <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/company/history.html\">since 1992</a>, not just as an occasional utility, but as part of my daily arsenal of essential tools.</p>\n\n<p>But I get the feeling that Chayka would be better served switching from TextEdit to Apple Notes for most of these things he’s creating. Saving a whole pile of notes to yourself as text files on your desktop, with no organization into sub-folders, isn’t wrong. The whole point of “just put it on the desktop” is to absolve yourself of thinking about where to file something properly. That’s friction, and if you face a bit of friction every time you want to jot something down, it increases the likelihood that <em>you won’t jot it down</em> because you didn’t want to deal with the friction.</p>\n\n<p>You actually don’t need to save or name documents in TextEdit anymore. One of the best changes to MacOS in the last two decades has been <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-desktop-dock-settings-mchlp1119/15.0/mac\">the  persistence of open document windows</a>, including unsaved changes to existing files, and never-saved untitled document windows. Try this: open TextEdit, make a new untitled document, and type something — anything — into the new window. Next, don’t just quit TextEdit, but force quit it (⌥⌘Esc). Relaunch TextEdit, and your unsaved new document should be right where you left it, with every character you typed.</p>\n\n<p>But a big pile of unorganized RTF files on your desktop — or a big pile of unsaved document windows that remain open, in perpetuity, in TextEdit — is no way to live. You can use TextEdit like that, it <em>supports</em> being used like that, but it wasn’t <em>designed</em> to be used like that.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Notes was designed to be used like this. Open Notes, ⌘N, type whatever you want, and switch back to whatever you were doing before. There is no Save command. There are no files. And while a few dozen text files on your desktop starts to look messy, and makes individual items hard to find, you can stash <em>thousands</em> of notes in Apple Notes and they just organize themselves into a simple list, sorted, by default, by most recently modified. You can create folders and assign tags in Notes, but you don’t need to. Don’t make busy work for yourself. And with iCloud, you get fast reliable syncing of all your notes to all of your other Apple devices: iPhone, iPad, Vision Pro, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/create-and-view-notes-apdc6fb0a03f/watchos\">even your Watch now</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes you just want to stick with what you’re used to. I get it. I am, very much, a creature of habit. And TextEdit is comforting for its simplicity, reliability, and unchanging consistency spanning literally decades.

The film debuted in 34\ntheaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It\nultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.\n1 political documentary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters\noverseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling\ndistribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales\nare expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shocker.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/29/amazon-melania-spending\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Amazon’s Spending on ‘Melania’ Is a Barely Concealed Bribe’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",

The two fundamental models for apps are library-based (like Apple Notes) and document-based (like TextEdit). Document-based apps create and open files from the file system.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both models, but one of the advantages to library-based apps is that they more easily allow the developer to create custom URL schemes to link to items in the app’s library. Omni Links is an ambitious solution to bring that to document-based apps. Omni Links let you copy URLs that link not just to an OmniOutliner document, but to any specific row within an OmniOutliner document. And you can paste those URLs into any app you want (like, say, Apple Notes or <a href=\"https://www.culturedcode.com/\">Things</a>, or events in your calendar app). From the perspective of other apps, they’re just URLs that start with <code>omnioutliner://</code>. They’re not based on anything as simplistic as a file’s pathname. They’re a robust way to link to a unique document, or a specific row within that document. Create an Omni Link on your Mac, and that link will work on your iPhone or iPad too — or vice versa. This is a very complex problem to solve, but Omni Links delivers on the age-old promise of “It just works”, abstracting all the complexity.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been using OmniOutliner for at least two decades now, and Omni Links strikes me as one of the best features they’ve ever added.
