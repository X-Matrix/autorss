  "summary": "An ordinal preference domain is a subset of preference orders that the voters are allowed to cast in an election. We introduce and study the notion of outer diversity of a domain and evaluate its value for a number of well-known structured domains, such as the single-peaked, single-crossing, group-separable, and Euclidean ones.",
