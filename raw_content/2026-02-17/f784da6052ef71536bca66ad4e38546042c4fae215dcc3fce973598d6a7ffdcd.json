  "summary": "Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution visualization of coronary vessel anatomy but presents challenges due to noise, imaging artifacts, and complex tissue structures. This paper proposes a fully automated pipeline for vessel segmentation and classification in OCT images using machine learning techniques. The proposed method integrates image preprocessing, guidewire artifact removal, polar-to-Cartesian transformation, unsupervised K-means clustering, and local feature extraction. These features are used to train Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine classifiers for pixel-wise vessel classification. Experimental results demonstrate excellent performance, achieving precision, recall, and F1-score values up to 1.00 and overall classification accuracy of 99.68%. The proposed approach provides accurate vessel boundary detection while maintaining low computational complexity and requiring minimal manual annotation. This method offers a reliable and efficient solution for automated OCT image analysis and has potential applications in clinical decision support and real-time medical image processing.",
