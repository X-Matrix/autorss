  "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition necessitating early and precise diagnosis to provide prompt clinical management. Given the paramount importance of early diagnosis, recent studies have increasingly focused on computer-aided diagnostic models to enhance precision and reliability. However, most graph-based approaches still rely on fixed structural designs, which restrict their flexibility and limit generalization across heterogeneous patient data. To overcome these limitations, the Meta-Relational Copula-Based Graph Attention Network (MRC-GAT) is proposed as an efficient multimodal model for AD classification tasks. The proposed architecture, copula-based similarity alignment, relational attention, and node fusion are integrated as the core components of episodic meta-learning, such that the multimodal features, including risk factors (RF), Cognitive test scores, and MRI attributes, are first aligned via a copula-based transformation in a common statistical space and then combined by a multi-relational attention mechanism. According to evaluations performed on the TADPOLE and NACC datasets, the MRC-GAT model achieved accuracies of 96.87% and 92.31%, respectively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing diagnostic models. Finally, the proposed model confirms the robustness and applicability of the proposed method by providing interpretability at various stages of disease diagnosis.",
