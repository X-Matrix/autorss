I haven't used it for a long time and the battery has gone overdischarge. I hope it will come back to life. Unfortunately, there are no replacements available for sale at the moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure class=\"insert-image\"><img alt=\"iFixit soldering hub torn down - used with permission\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/ode-to-the-aa-battery/ifixit-soldering-usb-battery-merocle-torn-down.jpg\" width=\"500\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>Devices with built-in rechargeable batteries have been bugging me a lot lately. It's convenient to have a device you can take with you and use anywhere. And with modern Li-ion cells, battery life is remarkable.</p>",
