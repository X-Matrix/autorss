  "summary": "<p>In 2025, I published 141 posts, 33 of which made it to the front page of <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> or similar aggregators. I definitely wrote more in the first half of the year (an average of around 15 posts per month, down to around 8 in the second half), but overall I’m happy with my consistency. Here are some posts I’m really proud of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/large-established-codebases\"><em>Mistakes engineers make in large established codebases</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/good-times-are-over\"><em>The good times in tech are over</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/good-system-design\"><em>Everything I know about good system design</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/pure-and-impure-engineering\"><em>Pure and impure software engineering</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/seeing-like-a-software-company\"><em>Seeing like a software company</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As it turns out, I was the <a href=\"https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/\">third most popular blogger</a> on Hacker News this year, behind the excellent Simon Willison and Jeff Geerling. I don’t put a lot of effort into appealing to Hacker News specifically, but I do think my natural style meshes well with the Hacker News commentariat (even if they’re often quite critical).</p>\n<p>I got hundreds of emails from readers this year (I went through Gmail and made it to 200 in the last three months of the year before I stopped counting). Getting email about my posts is one of the main reasons I write, so it was great to read people’s anecdotes and hear what they agreed or disagreed with. I also want to thank the people who wrote blog-length responses to what I wrote (most recently Alex Wennerberg’s <a href=\"https://alexwennerberg.com/blog/2025-11-28-engineering.html\"><em>Software Engineers Are Not Politicians</em></a> and Lalit Maganti’s <a href=\"https://lalitm.com/software-engineering-outside-the-spotlight/\"><em>Why I Ignore The Spotlight as a Staff Engineer</em></a>).</p>\n<p>I don’t have proper traffic statistics for the year - more on that later - but I remember I peaked in August with around 1.3 million monthly views. In December I had 700 thousand: less, but still not so shabby. I finally set up email subscription in May, via <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/\">Buttondown</a>, and now have just over 2,500 email subscribers to the blog. I have no way of knowing how many people are subscribed via RSS<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The biggest housekeeping change for my blog this year is that everything now costs a lot more money. I had to upgrade my Netlify plan and my Buttondown plan multiple times as my monthly traffic increased. I pay $9 a month for Netlify analytics, which is pretty bad: it doesn’t store data past 30 days, only tracks the top-ten referrers, and doesn’t let me break down traffic by source. I’m trialing Plausible, since I learned Simon Willison is <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46471538\">using it</a>, but once the trial expires it’s going to set me back $60 a month. Of course, I can afford it - on the scale of hobbies, it’s closer to rock climbing than skiing - but there’s still been a bit of sticker shock for something I’m used to thinking of as a free activity.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for reading, and extra thanks to those of you who have posted my articles to aggregators, emailed me, messaged on LinkedIn, or left comments. I look forward to writing another ~140 posts in 2026!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>My analytics don’t track requests to <code class=\"language-text\">/rss</code>, but even if they did I imagine some RSS feed readers would be caching the contents of my feed.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref-1\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
