  "summary": "<blockquote cite=\"https://crawshaw.io/blog/eight-more-months-of-agents\"><p>I am having more fun programming than I ever have, because so many more of the programs I wish I could find the time to write actually exist. I wish I could share this joy with the people who are fearful about the changes agents are bringing. The fear itself I understand, I have fear more broadly about what the end-game is for intelligence on tap in our society. But in the limited domain of writing computer programs these tools have brought so much exploration and joy to my work.</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://crawshaw.io/blog/eight-more-months-of-agents\">David Crawshaw</a>, Eight more months of agents</p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a></p>",
