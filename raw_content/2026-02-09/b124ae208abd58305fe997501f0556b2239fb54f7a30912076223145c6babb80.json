  "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://www.megangreenwell.com/book\"><em>Bad Company: Private Equity and the Death of the American Dream</em></a> is a book about private equity in the United States. My main takeaway: <em>private equity is bad</em>. I also learned a few other straightforward lessons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Private equity has one goal: to maximize shareholder value. As you might imagine, this causes lots of problems.</li>\n<li>Private equity firms may acquire a business with no intention of keeping it running. It can be more profitable to shutter the business.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp\">Leveraged buyouts</a> dramatically lower the risk to the private equity buyer.</li>\n<li>Government subsidies and laws often make it easier for private equity firms to operate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This book further cemented a belief I hold: it&rsquo;s harmful to pursue profit above all else.</p>",
