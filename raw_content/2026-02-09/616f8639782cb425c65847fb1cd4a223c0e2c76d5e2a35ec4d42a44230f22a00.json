  "summary": "Recently I was doing some work decoding the new Galileo High Accuracy Service data. In short, this new service will allow Galileo (&ldquo;European GPS&rdquo;) users to achieve decimeter-level accuracy, which is nice. This &ldquo;HAS&rdquo; data is transmitted highly redundantly by making good use of Reed-Solomon encoding.\nTo work with this data, I attempted to learn more about Reed-Solomon and I found almost all explanations were useless to me - oodles of advanced math, but no guidance of how to use R-S in practice.",
