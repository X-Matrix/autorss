  "summary": "An oft discussed hypothesis is that certain apps, usually Facebook, listens to and analyses your surroundings for ad targeting purposes. It has never been conclusively proven that Facebook does this, but there are plenty of people on the internet with anecdotal stories of ads appearing for products they’ve only discussed IRL. In iOS 14 Apple added indicators to highlight when an app is using the device’s microphone or camera. Since I have access to a decently sized collection of app privacy details I decided to have a look if any apps admit to this behaviour.",
