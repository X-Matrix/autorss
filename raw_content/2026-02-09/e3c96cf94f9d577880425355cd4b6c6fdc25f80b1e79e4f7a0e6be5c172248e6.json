Does it dismiss the box entirely and I never have to see it? Or does it validate the reminder schedule? What if I just don't want OneDrive? Microsoft has embedded it so deep into Windows that there are no easy ways of getting rid of it. I would understand if they had asked me when I set up my machine the first time, but why every single time?</p>\n\n<p>This is the illusion of choice. It is \"Get it now\" or \"Get it later\". What I'm looking for is the \"Get it never option!\"</p>\n\n<p>Dark patterns at their finest.</p>\n\n<div class=\"art-image\">\n<img alt=\"One drive turn on option\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://cdn.idiallo.com/images/assets/daily/88/onedrive.jpg\" width=\"368\" />\n<p>After I restarted, I got this!</p>\n</div>",
