You are very welcome to improve this page via GitHub!\nIn this chapter we&rsquo;re going to take the neural network we made earlier, but actually make it do some learning itself. And, oddly enough, this demonstration will again likely simultaneously make you wonder &ldquo;is this all??&rdquo; and also impress you by what even this trivial stuff can do.",
