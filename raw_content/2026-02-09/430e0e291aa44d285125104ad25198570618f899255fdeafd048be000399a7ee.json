  "summary": "<p><img alt=\"cover.jpg\" class=\"newsletter-image\" src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f821145f-d310-403c-88f4-327758a66606.jpg?w=480&amp;fit=max\" /></p>\n<p>It's taken four months, but the next release of <a href=\"https://logicforprogrammers.com\" target=\"_blank\">Logic for Programmers is now available</a>! v0.13 is over 50,000 words, making it both 20% larger than v0.12 and officially the longest thing I have ever written.<sup id=\"fnref:longest\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:longest\">1</a></sup> Full release notes are <a href=\"https://github.com/logicforprogrammers/book-assets/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, but I'll talk a bit about the biggest changes. </p>\n<p>For one, every chapter has been rewritten. Every single one. They span from <em>relatively</em> minor changes to complete chapter rewrites. After some rough git diffing, I think I deleted about 11,000 words?<sup id=\"fnref:gross-additions\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:gross-additions\">2</a></sup> The biggest change is probably to the Alloy chapter. After many sleepless nights, I realized the right approach wasn't to teach Alloy as a <em>data modeling</em> tool but to teach it as a <em>domain modeling</em> tool. Which technically means the book no longer covers data modeling.</p>\n<p>There's also a lot more connections between the chapters. The introductory math chapter, for example, foreshadows how each bit of math will be used in the future techniques. I also put more emphasis on the general \"themes\" like the expressiveness-guarantees tradeoff (working title). One theme I'm really excited about is compatibility (extremely working title). It turns out that the <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/the-liskov-substitution-principle-does-more-than/\" target=\"_blank\">Liskov substitution principle</a>/subtyping in general, <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/refinement-without-specification/\" target=\"_blank\">database migrations</a>, backwards-compatible API changes, and <a href=\"https://hillelwayne.com/post/refinement/\" target=\"_blank\">specification refinement</a> all follow <em>basically</em> the same general principles. I'm calling this \"compatibility\" for now but prolly need a better name.</p>\n<p>Finally, there's just a lot more new topics in the various chapters. <code>Testing</code> properly covers structural and metamorphic properties. <code>Proofs</code> covers proof by induction and proving recursive functions (in an exercise). <code>Logic Programming</code> now finally has a section on answer set programming. You get the picture.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>There's a lot I still want to add to the book: proper data modeling, data structures, type theory, model-based testing, etc. But I've added new material for two year, and if I keep going it will never get done. So with this release, all the content is in!</p>\n<p>Just like all the content was in <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/five-unusual-raku-features/\" target=\"_blank\">two Novembers ago</a> and <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-project-update/\" target=\"_blank\">two Januaries ago</a> and <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-turns-one/\" target=\"_blank\">last July</a>. To make it absolutely 100% for sure that I won't be tempted to add anything else, I passed the whole manuscript over to a copy editor. So if I write more, it won't get edits. That's a pretty good incentive to stop.</p>\n<p>I also need to find a technical reviewer and proofreader. Once all three phases are done then it's \"just\" a matter of fixing the layout and finding a good printer. I don't know what the timeline looks like but I really want to have something I can hold in my hands before the summer.</p>\n<p>(I also need to get notable-people testimonials. Hampered a little in this because I'm trying real hard not to quid-pro-quo, so I'd like to avoid anybody who helped me or is mentioned in the book. And given I tapped most of my network to help me... I've got some ideas though!)</p>\n<p>There's still a lot of work ahead. Even so, for the first time in two years I don't have research to do or sections to write and it feels so crazy. Maybe I'll update my blog again! Maybe I'll run a workshop! Maybe I'll go outside if Chicago ever gets above 6°F! </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Conference Season</h2>\n<p>After a pretty slow 2025, the 2026 conference season is looking to be pretty busy! Here's where I'm speaking so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://qconlondon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">QCon London</a>, March 16-19</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://craft-conf.com/2026\" target=\"_blank\">Craft Conference</a>, Budapest, June 4-5</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://softwareshould.work/\" target=\"_blank\">Software Should Work</a>, Missouri, July 16-17</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hfpug.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Houston Functional Programmers</a>, Virtual, December 3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the first three I'm giving variations of my talk \"How to find bugs in systems that don't exist\", which I gave last year at <a href=\"https://systemsdistributed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Systems Distributed</a>. Last one will ideally be a talk based on LfP. </p>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:longest\">\n<p>The second longest was my 2003 NaNoWriMo. The third longest was <em>Practical TLA+</em>.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:longest\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:gross-additions\">\n<p>This means I must have written 20,000 words total. For comparison, the v0.1 release was 19,000 words.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:gross-additions\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
