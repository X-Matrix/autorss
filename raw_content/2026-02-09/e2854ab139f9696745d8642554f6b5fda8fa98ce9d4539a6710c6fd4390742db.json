Mainframe computers command their much higher prices because they have much more sophisticated input/output systems.\"</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>After extensive searches through archival documents, I found usages of the term \"main frame\" dating back to 1952, much earlier than previously reported.\nIn particular, the introduction of frames to package the IBM 701 computer led to the use of the word \"main frame\" for\nthat computer and later ones.\nThe term went through various shades of meaning and remained fairly obscure for many years. In the mid-1970s,\nthe term started describing a large computer, essentially its modern meaning.\nIn the 1980s, the term escaped the computer industry and appeared in dictionaries, encyclopedias, and newspapers. \nAfter peaking in the 1990s, the term declined in usage (tracking the decline in mainframe computers), but the term and the mainframe computer both survive.</p>\n<p>Two factors drove the popularity of the word \"mainframe\" in the 1980s with\nits current meaning of a large computer.\nFirst, the terms \"microcomputer\" and \"minicomputer\" led to linguistic pressure for a parallel term for large computers.\nFor instance, the business press needed a word to describe IBM and other large computer manufacturers.\nWhile \"server\" is the modern term, \"mainframe\" easily filled the role back then and was nicely alliterative with \"microcomputer\" and \"minicomputer.\"<span id=\"fnref:networking\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:networking\">38</a></span></p>\n<p>Second, up until the 1980s, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory\">prototype</a> meaning for \"computer\" was a large mainframe, typically IBM.<span id=\"fnref:prototype\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:prototype\">39</a></span>\nBut as millions of home computers were sold in the early 1980s, the prototypical \"computer\" shifted to smaller machines.\nThis left a need for a term for large computers, and \"mainframe\" filled that need.\nIn other words, if you were talking about a large computer in the 1970s, you could say \"computer\" and people would assume you meant a mainframe.\nBut if you said \"computer\" in the 1980s, you needed to clarify if it was a large computer.</p>\n<p>The word \"mainframe\" is almost 75 years old and both the computer and the word have gone through extensive\nchanges in this time.  The \"death of the mainframe\" has <a href=\"https://planetmainframe.com/2021/05/a-quick-look-back-the-not-demise-of-the-ibm-mainframe/\">been proclaimed</a> for well over 30 years but mainframes are still hanging on.\nWho knows what meaning \"mainframe\" will have in another 75 years?</p>\n<p>Follow me on Bluesky (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/righto.com\">@righto.com</a>) or \n<a href=\"https://www.righto.com/feeds/posts/default\">RSS</a>.

There was no mainframe “inventor” who coined the term.  Probably “main frame” originally referred to the frames (designed for telephone switches) holding processor circuits and main memory, separate from racks or cabinets holding other components. Over time, main frame became mainframe and came to mean 'big computer.'\"\n(Based on my research, I don't think telephone switches have any connection to computer mainframes.)</p>\n<p>Several sources explain that the mainframe is named after the frame used to construct the computer.\nThe <a href=\"http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/mainframe.html\">Jargon File</a> has a long discussion, stating that the term \"originally referring to the cabinet containing the central processor unit or ‘main frame’.\"\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?ppis=_c&amp;id=SAwPAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22main+frame%22\">Ken Uston's Illustrated Guide to the IBM PC</a> (1984) has the\ndefinition \n\"MAIN FRAME A large, high-capacity computer, so named because the CPU of this kind of computer used to be mounted on a frame.\"\nIBM <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/documents/pdf/glossary.pdf\">states</a> that mainframe \"Originally referred to the central processing unit of a large computer, which occupied the largest or central frame (rack).\"\nThe <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/microsoftcomputerdictionaryfifthedition_202002/page/n335/mode/2up\">Microsoft Computer Dictionary</a> (2002)\nstates that the name mainframe \"is derived from 'main frame', the cabinet originally used to house the processing unit of such computers.\"\nSome discussions of the origin of the word \"mainframe\" are\n<a href=\"http://www.memidex.com/mainframe+digital-computer\">here</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-origin-of-the-term-mainframe\">here</a>,\n<a href=\"https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/28290/origin-of-the-word-mainframe\">here</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-origin-of-the-term-mainframe\">here</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mainframe_computer/Archive_2#Speculation_on_evolution_of_the_word_mainframe\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The phrase \"main frame\" in non-computer contexts has a very old but irrelevant history, describing\nmany things that have a frame.\nFor example, it appears in thousands of patents from the 1800s, including \n<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US7A/en\">drills</a>,\n<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US700A/en\">saws</a>,\n<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US2476A/en\">a meat cutter</a>,\n<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US7022A/en\">a cider mill</a>,\n<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US9305A/en\">printing presses</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US29100A/en\">corn planters</a>.\nThis shows that it was natural to use the phrase \"main frame\" when describing something constructed from frames.\nTelephony uses a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_distribution_frame\">Main distribution frame</a> or \"main frame\" for wiring, going back to\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=iIFRAAAAMAAJ&amp;ppis=_c&amp;dq=%22main%20distribution%20frame%22&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=%22main%20distribution%20frame%22&amp;f=false\">1902</a>.\nSome people claim that the computer use of \"mainframe\" is related to the telephony use, but I don't think they\nare related. In particular, a telephone main distribution frame looks nothing like a computer mainframe.\nMoreover, the computer use and the telephony use developed separately; if the computer use started in, say,\nBell Labs, a connection would be more plausible.</p>\n<p>IBM patents with \"main frame\" include a <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US1742819A/en\">scale</a> (1922),\na <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US1926896A/en\">card sorter</a> (1927),\na <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US1976618A/en\">card duplicator</a> (1929), and a <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US2063482A/en\">card-based accounting machine</a> (1930).\nIBM's incidental uses of \"main frame\" are probably unrelated to modern usage,\nbut they are a reminder that punch card data processing started decades before the modern computer.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:etymology\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:701-installation\">\n<p>It is unclear why the IBM 701 installation manual is dated August 27, 1952 but the drawing is dated 1953.\n   I assume the drawing was updated after the manual was originally produced.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:701-installation\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:construction\">\n<p>This footnote will survey the construction techniques of some early computers;\nthe key point is that building a computer on frames was not an obvious technique.\nENIAC (1945), the famous early vacuum tube computer, was constructed from 40 panels forming three walls filling a room (<a href=\"http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/univOfPennsylvania/eniac/ENIAC_Operating_Manual_Jun46.pdf\">ref</a>, <a href=\"https://ftp.arl.army.mil/mike/comphist/46eniac-report/chap1.html\">ref</a>).\nEDVAC (1949) was built from large cabinets or panels (<a href=\"https://ftp.arl.army.mil/~mike/comphist/61ordnance/chap3.html\">ref</a>)\nwhile ORDVAC and CLADIC (1949) were built on racks (<a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//dc.html?doc=5008283-Office-of-Naval-Research-Mathematical-Sciences\">ref</a>).\nOne of the first commercial computers, UNIVAC 1 (1951), had a \"Central Computer\" organized as bays, divided into three sections, with tube \"chassis\" plugged in\n(<a href=\"http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/univac/univac1/UNIVAC1_Maintenance_Manual_Jan58.pdf\">ref</a> <!-- page 1-26 -->).\nThe Raytheon computer (1951) and\nMoore School Automatic Computer (1952) (<a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//dc.html?doc=5008291-Office-of-Naval-Research-Mathematical-Sciences\">ref</a>) were built from racks.\nThe MONROBOT VI (1955) was described as constructed from the \"conventional rack-panel-cabinet form\"\n(<a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//dc.html?doc=5008304-Office-of-Naval-Research-Physical-Sciences\">ref</a>).&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:construction\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:moving\">\n<p>The size and construction of early computers often made it difficult to install or move them.\nThe early computer ENIAC required 9 months to move from Philadelphia to the Aberdeen Proving Ground.

They\nare character or byte oriented except in the case of the large-scale\nscientific machines, which have 36, 48, or 60-bit words. The predominant\nportion (60% to 80%) of these computers is rented, usually for\n$2,000 a month or more.

to which other\ncomputers may be connected so that they can share facilities.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/microsoftcomputerdictionaryfifthedition_202002/page/n335/mode/2up\">The Microsoft Computer Dictionary</a> (2002) had\nan amusingly critical definition of mainframe: \"A type of large computer system (in the past often water-cooled), the primary data processing resource for many\nlarge businesses and organizations.\nSome mainframe operating systems and solutions are over 40 years old and have the capacity to store year values only as two digits.\"&#160;<a

href=\"http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/7030/Planning_A_Computer_System.pdf\">Planning a Computer System</a> (1962) describes\nhow the Stretch computer's circuitry was assembled into frames, with the CPU consisting of 18 frames.\nThe picture below shows how a \"frame\" was, in fact, constructed from a metal frame.</p>\n<p><a

a variety of ways.\nIt is one of those phrases that seems obvious until you think about it more closely.\nOn the one hand, a computer such as the Apollo Guidance Computer can be considered general purpose because\nit runs a variety of programs, even though the computer was designed for one specific mission.\nOn the other hand, minicomputers were often contrasted with \"general-purpose computers\" because customers\nwould buy a minicomputer for a specific application, unlike a mainframe which would be used for a variety of\napplications.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:general-purpose\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 35 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:ngrams\">\n<p>The n-gram graph is from the <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams\">Google Books Ngram Viewer</a>.\nThe curves on the graph should be taken with a grain of salt.\nFirst, the usage of words in published books is likely to lag behind \"real world\" usage.\nSecond, the number of usages in the data set is small, especially at the beginning.\nNonetheless, the n-gram graph generally agrees with what I've seen looking at documents directly.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:ngrams\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 36 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:want-ads\">\n<p>More examples of \"mainframe\" in want ads:\nA 1966 ad from Western Union in <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/116633824/?terms=mainframe\">The Arizona Republic</a> looking for experience\n\"in a systems engineering capacity dealing with both mainframe and peripherals.\"\nA 1968 ad in <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/188420280/?terms=mainframe\">The Minneapolis Star</a> for an engineer with knowledge of \"mainframe and peripheral hardware.\"\nA 1968 ad from SDS in <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/383111407/?terms=mainframe\">The Los Angeles Times</a> for an engineer to design \"circuits for computer mainframes and peripheral equipment.\"\nA 1968 ad in <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/272539959/?terms=mainframe\">Fort Lauderdale News</a> for \"Computer mainframe and peripheral logic design.\"\nA 1972 ad in <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/385740808/?terms=mainframe\">The Los Angeles Times</a> saying \"Mainframe or peripheral [experience] highly desired.\"\nIn most of these ads, the mainframe was in contrast to the peripherals.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:want-ads\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 37 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:networking\">\n<p>A related factor is the development of remote connections from a microcomputer to a mainframe in the 1980s.\nThis led to the need for a word to describe the remote computer, rather than saying \"I connected my home\ncomputer to the other computer.\"\nSee the many books and articles on connecting \"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22micro+to+mainframe%22&amp;tbm=bks&amp;dpr=1\">micro to mainframe</a>.\"&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:networking\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 38 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:prototype\">\n<p>To see how the prototypical meaning of \"computer\" changed in the 1980s, I examined the \"Computer\" article in encyclopedias from that time.\nThe <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000unse/page/136\">1980 Concise Encyclopedia of the Sciences</a>\ndiscusses a large system with punched-card input.\nIn <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/worldbookencyclo04worl/page/740\">1980</a>, the World Book article focused on mainframe systems, starting with a photo of an IBM System/360 Model 40 mainframe.\nBut in the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/1981worldbookyea00chic/page/538\">1981 supplement</a> and the\n<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/worldbookencyclo04worl_1/page/740\">1984 encyclopedia</a>, the World Book article opened with a handheld computer game,\na desktop computer, and a \"large-scale computer.\" The article described microcomputers, minicomputers, and mainframes.\n<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/funkwagnalls198307bram/page/80\">Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia</a> (1983) was in the middle of the transition;\nthe article focused on large computers and had photos of IBM machines, but mentioned that future growth is expected in microcomputers.\nBy <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/worldbookencyclo04chic0/page/908\">1994</a>, the World Book article's main focus was the personal computer, although the mainframe still had a few paragraphs and a photo.\nThis is evidence that the prototypical meaning of \"computer\" underwent a dramatic shift in the early 1980s from a mainframe to\na balance between small and large computers, and then to the personal computer.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:prototype\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 39 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
