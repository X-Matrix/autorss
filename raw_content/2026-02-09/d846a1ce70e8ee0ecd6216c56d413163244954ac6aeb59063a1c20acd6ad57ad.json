  "summary": "<p>In the Q&amp;A session following my EuroPython 2025 presentation about the <a href=\"https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microdot\">Microdot</a> web framework, a member of the audience asked me what the performance of MicroPython running on a microcontroller is. This took me a bit by surprise, because I really had no way to quantify it, I just knew it was, in vague terms, not great. I never questioned the low performance, because it was never a problem for me.</p>\n<p>My answer to the question was that microcontrollers cannot replace a computer, and that these devices are only useful for small, focused tasks that are not demanding in any way. But after returning from the conference I kept thinking about this question, which piqued my curiosity. So I decided to build a better mental image of the performance these little machines have.</p>\n<p>In this blog post I want to share some results that compare Python code running on a few microcontroller boards that I have collected through my experiments with hardware, along with my laptop and a Raspberry Pi 4 to help put things into perspective.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"photo of several microcontrollers\" src=\"/static/images/micropython-benchmark-top.jpg\" /></p>",
