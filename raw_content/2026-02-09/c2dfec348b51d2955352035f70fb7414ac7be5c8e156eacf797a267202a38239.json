  "summary": "<p>Phew, it&rsquo;s been a week. Last week, I travelled all the way to Rochester, New York, to attend the NarraScope 2024 conference at The Strong National Museum of Play. I $ for three days of inspiration, connection, and storytelling innovation&hellip; and it was <strong>awesome</strong>!</p>\n<p>The conference kicked off with a captivating keynote from Nat Clayton, fresh from their work on Inkle&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Highland Song.&rdquo; Their talk on spatial storytelling and level design perfectly set the tone for a conference exploring the intersection of narrative and interactivity. It really was a banger. (Update: You can watch it now!)</p>",
