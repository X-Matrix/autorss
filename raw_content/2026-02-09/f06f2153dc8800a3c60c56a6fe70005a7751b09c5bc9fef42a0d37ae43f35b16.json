You are very welcome to improve this page via GitHub!\nIn the previous chapter we described how automatic differentiation of the result of neural networks works.\nIn the first and second chapters we designed and trained a one-layer neural network that could distinguish images of the digit 3 and the digit 7, and the network did so very well.",
