  "summary": "<p>We just had AGM for Tasmanian Game Makers, Inc. (TasGM), and for the third year in a row I was pleasantly surprised to be elected President. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to working with the new committee to continue pushing the video game industry in Tasmania along, get the Tasmanian Games Incubator going as part of TasGM, and helping Screen Tasmania run Level Up.</p>\n<p>With thanks to our outgoing board member, and our fantastic community and financial members.</p>",
