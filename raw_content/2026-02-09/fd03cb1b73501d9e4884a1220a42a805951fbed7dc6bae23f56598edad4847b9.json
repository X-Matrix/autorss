  "summary": "2018 is an exciting time to be a programmer, with so many good &ldquo;full service&rdquo; programming languages to choose from: C, C++ 2017, Go, Python, Rust and who knows Swift too. Programming languages are complicated beasts - even the simplest languages have specifications that run (or would run) in the hundreds of pages, and once you include everything, no serious language is likely to clock in under a thousand.\nWith this comes the fact that every programming language has good parts, and frequently even more bad parts.",
