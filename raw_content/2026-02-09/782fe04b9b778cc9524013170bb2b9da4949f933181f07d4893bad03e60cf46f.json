  "summary": "Around a million years ago (it feels like) but actually 9 months ago I delivered a brief talk on end to end encryption for the European Internet Forum at the European Parliament.\nUpdate: in February 2024, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in rather strong words that forcing providers to break end to end encryption violates human rights.\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. If you can spare 9 minutes, I recommend watching the video.",
