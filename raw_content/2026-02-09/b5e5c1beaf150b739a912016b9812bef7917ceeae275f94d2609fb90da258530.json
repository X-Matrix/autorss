  "summary": "<p>Half Life and Half Life 2 are my favorite games. I've played them through multiple times. I played Half Life 1 for the first time in 1999 or 2000, can't remember. My computer at the time could barely run it.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, it's a struggle to play older PC games on a Mac. There are two fundamental issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A while ago macOS had dropped support for 32-bit applications. </li>\n<li>Recently, Apple hardware migrated from Intel x86 to Arm architecture.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My machine is Mac Studio 2023 M2 Max 64GB RAM, running macOS 15.3.2.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.exotext.com/1/bM3p8Aos3Jr3U_09cqQXG.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>In general, these are the options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Try Wine, or wine-based tools like <a href=\"https://getwhisky.app/\">Whisky</a> (free) or <a href=\"https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover\">Crossover</a> (paid).</li>\n<li>Install Windows in a VM like Parallels.</li>\n<li>Try to build a mac-native version.</li>\n<li><del>Just buy a cheap PC and stop torturing yourself.</del></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I did not have any success with barebones Wine or Whisky for Half Life 1 or 2. Crossover on the other hand — everything worked! HL1 runs great (look ma, maximum settings!). Can't believe that games is 27 years old. Wtf. Is this retro now?</p>\n<p>Half Life 2 runs great too... I thought. You see, even with max settings, it's buttery-smooth until it's not. The first 10-20 minutes of the game there's little very action, and everything is good. But once explosions start happening, fps drops to single digits, and it's very annoying. Hard to enjoy it.</p>\n<p>I've tried changing settings, and installing &quot;DirectX for Modern Games&quot;, like someone recommended. Frames drop less, but still pretty badly. </p>\n<p>Next I tried Parallels Desktop. It's a full-blown VM with an ARM-version of Windows 11. The OS itself runs without issues, it seems. I installed Steam into it, then installed Half Life 2, and it just runs fine! It's amazing because there are 2 layers of simulation happening. First there's the virtual machine, next there's x86 instruction set simulated on the ARM architecture. The amount of computation happening is staggering!</p>\n<p>FPS is not great at max settings, but at least it's stable. You can probably get much better results with Parallels Pro, which does not limit VRAM to 8GB.</p>\n<p>Parallels is not cheap though, and I'm not sure I need it for anything else. But hey, maybe play other games. And it's a subscription (of course), the Pro version is currently at €119.99 per year.</p>\n<p>So I decided to try another way: you can actually build a version of HL2 natively on Mac thanks to the fact that Valve's Source engine has been leaked in the past. There's a <a href=\"https://jxhug.notion.site/Guide-to-Installing-Half-Life-2-Using-Source-Engine-on-macOS-9fa5ffc910f5454ab0f0e5da2a9e5b9f\">guide here</a>, but I faced some issues, so below is my updated guide.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Homebrew.</li>\n<li>Install Xcode Command Line Tools <code>xcode-select --install</code></li>\n<li>Install dependencies:<pre><code class=\"hljs\">brew install sdl2 freetype2 fontconfig pkg-config opus jpeg jpeg-turbo libpng libedit python3\n</code></pre> (you may already have <code>python3</code> though)</li>\n<li>Clone source engine code <code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/nillerusr/source-engine</code> and cd into it.</li>\n<li>Configure and build:<pre><code class=\"hljs\">python3 waf configure -T release --prefix=&#x27;&#x27; --build-games=hl2\npython3 waf build\n</code></pre> (there may be numerous warnings, it's ok)</li>\n<li>Install into some directory:<pre><code class=\"hljs\">python3 waf install --destdir=&#x27;/users/&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;/Games/Gaming/Half Life 2&#x27;\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now the tricky part. If you just install Half Life 2 from steam, you'll get the latest version, which does not work with this method. The game loads, but all fonts and textures are corrupted. You need to get specifically a &quot;Pre-20th Anniversary build&quot;. So, buy the game if you haven't done it yet, then in your library press the gear icon → Properties → Betas and select this build.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.exotext.com/1/4UkFdYyBTK9W-q6hZrzHq.png\" /></p>\n<p>Now download the game normally via Steam. Once donwload is complete, click on the gear icon again → Manage → Browse Local Files. This will open a directory where Steam had installed the game. Now perform the following file manipulations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Move the <code>platform</code> directory to <code>~/Games/Gaming/Half Life 2</code>.</li>\n<li>Move everything from <code>hl2</code> directory to <code>~/Games/Gaming/Half Life 2/hl2</code> except for the <code>bin</code> directory (it already exists in <code>~/Games/Gaming/Half Life 2/hl2/bin</code>).</li>\n<li>Move <code>run.sh</code> file to <code>~/Games/Gaming/Half Life 2</code>.</li>\n<li>Delete everything remaining in the Steam game directory.</li>\n<li>Move everything from <code>~/Games/Gaming/Half Life 2</code> to the Steam game directory.</li>\n<li>Rename <code>hl2_launcher</code> to <code>hl2_osx</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is how the final structure looks like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs\">├── bin\n├── engine.log\n├── ep2\n├── episodic\n├── hl2\n│   ├── bin\n│   ├── cfg\n│   ├── demoheader.tmp\n│   ├── downloadlists\n│   ├── gameinfo.txt\n│   ├── gamepadui\n│   ├── ...\n├── hl2.sh\n├── hl2_osx\n├── lostcoast\n├── platform\n└── steam_appid.txt\n</code></pre><p>That's it. You should be able to run the game normally via Steam. I only played about 45 minutes so far, and it works without any issues. But I suspect something will break at some point.</p>",
