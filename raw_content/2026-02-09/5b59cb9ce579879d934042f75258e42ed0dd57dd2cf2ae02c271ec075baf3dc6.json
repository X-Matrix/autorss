  "summary": "<p>I wanted to have the most accurate timepiece possible mounted in my mini rack. Therefore I built this:</p>\n<figure class=\"insert-image\"><img alt=\"Raspberry Pi Pico GPS Clock for Mini Rack\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/pico-gps-clock-mini-rack/pico-gps-clock-mini-rack.jpg\" width=\"700\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>This is a GPS-based clock running on a Raspberry Pi Pico in a custom 1U 10&quot; rack faceplate. The clock displays time based on a GPS input, and will not display time until a GPS timing lock has been acquired.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you turn on the Pico, the display reads <code>----</code></li>\n<li>Upon 3D fix, you get a time on the clock, and the colon starts blinking</li>\n<li>If the 3D fix is lost, the colon goes solid</li>\n<li>When the 3D fix is regained, the colon starts blinking again</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For full details on designing and building this clock, see:</p>",
