  "summary": "<p>If you were 5 microseconds late today, blame it on NIST.</p>\n<p>Their facility in Boulder Colorado just had its power cut for multiple days. After a backup generator failed, their main ensemble clock lost track of UTC, or Universal Time Coordinated.</p>\n<p>But even if you used the <a href=\"https://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi\">NTP timing servers they run</a>, they were never off by more than 5 microseconds.</p>\n<p>5 μs might seem insignificant. But it <em>is</em> significant for scientists and universities who rely on NIST's more <a href=\"https://wsts.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/04-Judah-Levine.The-NIST-Fiber-Based-Time-Service.pdf\">specialized timing signals</a>.</p>",
