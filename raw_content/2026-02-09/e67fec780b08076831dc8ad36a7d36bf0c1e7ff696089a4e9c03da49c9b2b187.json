Beads has evolved a very complex command-line interface, with 100+ subcommands, each with many sub-subcommands, aliases, alternate syntaxes, and other affordances.</p>\n<p>The complicated Beads CLI isn’t for humans; it’s for agents. What I did was make their hallucinations real, over and over, by implementing whatever I saw the agents trying to do with Beads, until nearly every guess by an agent is now correct.</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://steve-yegge.medium.com/software-survival-3-0-97a2a6255f7b\">Steve Yegge</a>, Software Survival 3.0</p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/steve-yegge\">steve-yegge</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-agents\">ai-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/hallucinations\">hallucinations</a></p>",
