  "summary": "On the 22nd of October, I presented at the annual conference of my beloved NLNOG, the community of Dutch network operators. NLNOG is a national treasure, an international treasure even, since we do everything in English.\nNLNOG holds several events every year, where we entertain and educate each other with talks on new and old technologies. We also have food and drink afterwards, sometimes even several drinks.\nIt is a true community, with many of us anxiously looking forward to our next meetup.",
