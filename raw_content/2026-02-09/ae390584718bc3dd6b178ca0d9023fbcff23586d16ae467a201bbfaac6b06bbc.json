  "summary": "I read Dario’s The Adolescence of Technology and it’s scary. It assumes the perspective of a top-down ruler, that someone can and will get to control AI. This is taken as a given. Machines of Loving Grace assumes basically the same tone, that there are some “adults” in the room, and they will use AI like a tool to “fix” some supposed human problem, where those problems are framed in a very narrow worldview, say that like disease, poverty, and inequality are bad. (if you can’t steelman those things, you are too far gone for reason)",
