  "summary": "UPDATE: Back in December 2020 when this article was first posted, I noted that some receivers might not be able to deal with the advent of production signals from the eccentric satellites. This has indeed proved to be a problem for U-blox F9 series receivers in a specific configuration. The application note links to this article (thanks!) and also (correctly) states that the signals from the eccentric satellites do not in fact comply with the Galileo Open Service ICD.",
