  "summary": "<p>Good tip from “DifferentDan” on the Realmac customer forum, posted back in November:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I saw on macOS Tahoe 26.1, Apple finally added an option in the\nColumn View settings to automatically right size all columns\nindividually and that setting would persist, but I don’t really\nlike Liquid Glass (yet) so I haven’t updated to Tahoe.</p>\n\n<p>Looks like someone found a workaround however for those that are\nstill on Sequoia. Just open up Terminal on your Mac, copy in the\nbelow, and press return.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The one-line command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.finder _FXEnableColumnAutoSizing -bool YES; killall Finder\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Change <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code> if you want to go back.)</p>\n\n<p>Marcel Bresink’s <a href=\"http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html\">TinkerTool</a> is a great free app for adjusting hidden preferences using a proper GUI, and it turns out TinkerTool has exposed this hidden Finder preference for a few years now. You learn something every day. I enabled this a few days ago on MacOS 15 Sequoia, and it seems exactly like the implementation Apple has exposed in the Finder’s View Options window in Tahoe, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/resize_columns_to_fit_filenames\">which I wrote about Friday</a>. No better, no worse.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/26/hidden-pref-column-resizing\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘There’s a Hidden Preference to Auto-Resize Columns in the Finder on MacOS 14 and 15’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
