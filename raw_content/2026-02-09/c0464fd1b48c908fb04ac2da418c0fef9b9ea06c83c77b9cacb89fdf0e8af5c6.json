  "summary": "When Galileo (the European satellite navigation system) was proposed there was a lot of criticism. &ldquo;We already have the US GPS&rdquo;, and we&rsquo;d always be able to rely on our historical partner to take care of us. The US very much also said this. Yet, the EU persevered and now we have an independent worldwide navigation capability. And given recent developments, I think we can be well pleased that we don&rsquo;t have to rely on the US, China or Russia for this vital need!",
