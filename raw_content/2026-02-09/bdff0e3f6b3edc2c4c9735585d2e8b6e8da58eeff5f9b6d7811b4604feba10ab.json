  "summary": "Yesterday, NASA landed its InSight mission on Mars, and it all worked! The landing happened between 8 and 9PM local time, but I wanted to share the excitement with my kids&rsquo; classmates from school (aged between around 9 and 10), so I needed something that worked remotely.\nNASA provided a wonderful webcast in English, and although many children here in The Netherlands can follow that, I expected the stream to need more narration for the kids to truly experience the excitement of landing on another planet.",
