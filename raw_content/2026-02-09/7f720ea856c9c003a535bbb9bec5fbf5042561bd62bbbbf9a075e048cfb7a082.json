  "summary": "\"Burger Becky\" did a lot of great games, first at Interplay (Bard's Tale, Wasteland), then later at Logicware, where she and others did some great Mac ports including Jazz Jackrabbit and their Half-Life MacOS port which never actually saw the light of day, the infamous <a href=\"https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_(3DO)\">3DO port of Doom</a>, and of course the initial work on the <a href=\"/2021/02/the-quest-for-wolfenstein-3d-music-on.html\">IIgs version of Wolfenstein 3D</a>. Naturally these are just the highlights that come to mind of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/343/rebecca-ann-heineman/credits/\">a very long tenure</a> in the computer gaming world. She was very complimentary of TenFourFox back in the day when I was still developing that, and I'd long hoped she would release Mac Half-Life <a href=\"https://github.com/Olde-Skuul/doom3do\">like she did 3DO Doom</a> for the archivists to pick over. Sadly, word has come out that <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/legendary-game-designer-programmer-space-invaders-champion-and-lgbtq-trailblazer-rebecca-heineman-has-died/\">she has finally succumbed</a> to some sort of aggressive form of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. It's not a good way to go, and I hope her last moments were at peace.",
