  "summary": "Welcome back! In part 2 I discussed basic classes, threading, atomic operations, smart pointers, resource acquisition and (very briefly) namespaces.\nIn this part we continue with further C++ features that you can use to spice up your code &rsquo;line by line&rsquo;, without immediately having to use all 1400 pages of &lsquo;The C++ Programming Language&rsquo;.\nVarious code samples discussed here can be found on GitHub.\nIf you have any favorite things you&rsquo;d like to see discussed or questions, please hit me up on @bert_hu_bert or bert@hubertnet.",
