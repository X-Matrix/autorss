  "summary": "<p>I have for some time wanted to learn about the different VPN services offered by AWS. Having invested some money into a full Unifi setup I thought that it would be a good idea to setup an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpn-connections.html\">AWS Site-to-Site VPN and AWS Client VPN</a> connection between my lab network and my AWS account. I struggled for some time, messing around with the settings trying to get my <a href=\"https://www.ui.com/unifi-routing/usg/\">USG</a> to connect to the VPN server but it would not work. I probably wasted a couple of days of my free time pulling my hair out not really understanding why it wouldn&rsquo;t connect.</p>",
