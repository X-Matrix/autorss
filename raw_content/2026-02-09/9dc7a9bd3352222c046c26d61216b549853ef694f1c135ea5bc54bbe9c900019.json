  "summary": "<p>A few weeks ago I've released an extremely simple note-taking app called <a href=\"https://github.com/freetonik/textpod\">Textpod</a>. I just wanted a &quot;one big-ass text file&quot; kind of thing, but with file attachments and link archiving. The whole idea is that it's basically a text file with minor magic sprikled on top.</p>\n<p>The reception has been great! Seems like many people were looking for something similar. I also received lots of feedback and feature requests, which is fantastic. But... I found myself trying to justify the idea of the app to some folks, and it felt weird doing so.</p>\n<p>One common topic among emails and comments basically came down to &quot;your minimalistic app is great; can you add these 38 features though?&quot; Some features people want make perfect sense: tags, categories, authentication, encryption, multi-user access, rich-text editing, plugins, theming. They make sense for a note-taking app such as OneNote, Evernote, Obsidian, etc. You know, actually complex solutions for an ever-hungry crowd of productivity aficionados. But Textpod is kind of the opposite of those apps. If I were to implement those features, I'll end up building a &quot;worse Obsidian&quot; or something. </p>\n<p>If simplicity is <em>the</em> feature, I simply cannot implement most things people desire. By virtue of being non-trivial, those things would actively degrade the core feature of simplicity.</p>",
