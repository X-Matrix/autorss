  "summary": "&ldquo;The history of human thought would make it seem that there is difficulty in thinking of an idea even when all the facts are on the table&rdquo; &ndash; Isaac Asimov\nIn 2014, MIT&rsquo;s Technology Review wrote a very interesting article about an attempt to have Isaac Asimov be part of a group of scientists attempting to think outside of the box.
