  "summary": "The Netherlands is struggling with a shortage of primary school teachers, which as a nice side effect means that I get ample opportunities to do technical propaganda in the name of education.\nThis is a quick writeup of a lesson on how GPS (or in general, satellite based navigation) works. I&rsquo;d like to thank Jasper Vos and Michel Dingen of OBS De Notenkraker for the opportunity &amp; the very useful feedback on the lessons!",
