  "summary": "Welcome back! In part 3 I discussed classes, polymorphism, references and templates, and finally built a source indexer out of basic containers that achieves 60MB/s indexing speed.\nIn this part we continue with further C++ features that you can use to spice up your code &rsquo;line by line&rsquo;, without immediately having to use all 1400 pages of &lsquo;The C++ Programming Language&rsquo;. There is frequent reference to the indexing example from part 3 so you may want to make sure you know what that is about.",
