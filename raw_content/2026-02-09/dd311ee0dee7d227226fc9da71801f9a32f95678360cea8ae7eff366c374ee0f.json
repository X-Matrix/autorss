He&rsquo;s written <a href=\"https://hey.paris/books-and-events/books/\">over 20 books</a> for O&rsquo;Reilly and Wiley, talks about <a href=\"https://hey.paris/tags/space-news/\">space on ABC Radio</a>, occasionally teaches at the University of Tasmania, and has a PhD in Computing and a degree in medieval history (which is more useful than it sounds).</p>",
