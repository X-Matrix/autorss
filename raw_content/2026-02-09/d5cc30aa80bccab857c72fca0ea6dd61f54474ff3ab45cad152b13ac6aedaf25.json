  "summary": "<p>MG Siegler:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tim Cook is captured. There is simply no other explanation for his\nactions over the past year or so. But it perhaps culminated this\nweekend when Cook went to a special private showing of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_(film)?ref=spyglass.org\">the\ndocumentary <em>Melania</em></a> at the White House. Yes, <em>that</em>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump?ref=spyglass.org\">Melania</a>. That in and of itself would have probably been\nfine. I mean, it’s potentially problematic for a host of reasons\nthat I’ll get to, but such is our world right now. Then one shot — a gunshot — turned attending that movie screening into a\nstatement...</p>\n\n<p>While Cook was enjoying his popcorn and champagne with the likes\nof Mike Tyson, Tony Robbins, and other “VIPs”, it was complete and\nutter chaos on the streets of Minnesota. Just hours earlier, Alex\nPretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot and killed by ICE\nagents. Maybe, just maybe, postpone the movie premiere?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/27/mg-cook-melania\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘Aside From That, Mr. Cook, What Did You Think of the Movie?’’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
