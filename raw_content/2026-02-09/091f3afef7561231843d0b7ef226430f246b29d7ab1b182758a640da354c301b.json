  "summary": "<p>Your work inbox is probably not a place that sparks joy. It&rsquo;s full of people asking you to do things, complaints that something hasn&rsquo;t been done, and 571 messages marked urgent.</p>\n<p>In fact email is usually considered to be a hindrance, with many productivity guides recommending simply ignoring your email for large periods of the day, blocking out that time for focussed work.
