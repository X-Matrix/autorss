  "summary": "<p>I redesigned <a href=\"https://www.jim-nielsen.com\">my www website</a>. Why?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The end of year / holiday break is a great time to work on such things.</li>\n<li>I wanted to scratch an itch.</li>\n<li>Websites are <a href=\"https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/\">a worry stone</a> [<em>gestures at current state of the world</em>]</li>\n<li>Do I really need a reason? Nope.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I read something along the lines of “If you ship something that shows everything you’ve made, it’s dead on arrival.”</p>\n<p>Oooof. I feel that. It’s so hard to make a <em>personal</em> website that keeps up with your own <em>personal</em> evolution and change.</p>\n<p>But the hell if I’m not gonna try — and go through many existential crises in the process.</p>\n<p>I was chasing the idea of making my “home” page essentially a list of feeds, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hey, <a href=\"https://blog.jim-nielsen.com\">I blog</a>. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>\n<li>Yo, <a href=\"https://notes.jim-nielsen.com\">I take notes</a>. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>\n<li>Bruh, <a href=\"https://iosicongallery.com\">I collect iOS icons</a>. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>\n<li>Guess what? <a href=\"https://macosicongallery.com\">I collect macOS icons</a> too. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>\n<li>Hey, I ___. Here’s the latest: [1, 2, 3]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You get the idea.</p>\n<p>The thought was: if I condense the variety of the things I do online into a collection of feeds (hard-coded or live from other sites I publish), then I’ll never be out of date!</p>\n<p>Plus I love links. <a href=\"https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/following-links/\">I love following them.</a> I wanted my home page to be the start of a journey, not the end. A jumping off point, not a terminal one.</p>\n<p>At least that was the idea behind this iteration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"behind-the-scenes\">Behind the Scenes</h2>\n<p>I built the (static) site using <a href=\"https://weborigami.org\">Web Origami</a>.</p>\n<p>I loved it! Origami is great for dealing with feeds because it makes fetching data from the network and templating it incredibly succinct.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language language-html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>&gt;</span>Latest from my notes blog<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">h2</span>&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">ul</span>&gt;</span>\n  ${Tree.map(\n    (https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/feed.json).items.slice(0,3),\n    (note) =&gt; `<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">li</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;${note.url}&quot;</span>&gt;</span>${note.title}<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">li</span>&gt;</span>`\n  )}\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">ul</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>In just those few lines of code I:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fetch a JSON feed over the network</li>\n<li>Grabbed the 3 most recent entries</li>\n<li>Turn the data into markup</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, here’s the code showing my latest blog posts:</p>\n<p class=\"image-container\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of Web Origami code on the top and its output on the bottom (a list of blog post links).\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/built-with-origami-code-blog.png\" width=\"661\" />\n\n</p><p>And here’s the code showing the latest icons in my iOS collection:</p>\n<p class=\"image-container\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of Web Origami code on top and its output on the bottom (a grid of icons).\" height=\"548\" src=\"https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/built-with-origami-code-ios.png\" width=\"663\" />\n\n</p><p>Beautiful and succinct, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>Origami is a static site builder, so to keep my site “up to date” I just set Netlify to build my site every 24 hours which pulls data from a variety of sources, sticks it in a single HTML file, and publishes it as a website.</p>\n<p>The “build my site every 24 hours” isn’t quite as easy as you might think. You can use a <a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/build/functions/scheduled-functions/\">scheduled function on Netlify’s platform</a> but that requires <a href=\"https://tinloof.com/blog/how-to-build-cron-jobs-with-netlify-functions\">writing code</a> (which also means maintaining and debugging said code). That seems to be <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-to-schedule-deploys-with-netlify/\">Netlify’s official answer to the question: “How do I schedule deploys?”</a></p>\n<p>I went with something simpler — at least simpler to me. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup <a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/build/configure-builds/build-hooks/\">a build hook</a> on Netlify (which you have to do for the schedule function approach anyway).</li>\n<li>Use Apple’s Shortcuts app to create a shortcut that issues a POST request to my build hook.</li>\n<li>Use Shortcuts’ “Automation” feature to run that shortcut every day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the “cron server” in my case is my iPhone, which works great because it’s basically always connected to the internet. If I go off grid for a few days and my website doesn’t refresh, I’m ok with that trade-off.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://weborigami.org\"><p class=\"image-container\"><img alt=\"A tiny, pink origami bird with the text “Built with Origami”\" height=\"32\" src=\"https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/built-with-origami.jpg\" width=\"88\" /></p></a></p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/new-year-new-website-same-me/\">Email</a>\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>",
