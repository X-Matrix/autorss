  "summary": "Reading a good book is a great joy. And recommending a good book is almost as enjoyable.\nI&rsquo;ve long been fascinated by books on espionage, and this contributed in no small part to me eventually joining the Dutch intelligence world, and later, rejoining it in some fashion.\nIf you have favorite books that should be on this page, please let me know on bert@hubertnet.nl! I&rsquo;m especially looking for books written from different perspectives.",
