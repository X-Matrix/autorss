  "summary": "<p>Dell sent me two of their GB10 mini workstations to test:</p>\n<figure class=\"insert-image\"><img alt=\"Dell Pro Max with GB10\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/dells-version-dgx-spark-fixes-pain-points/dell-pro-max-gb10-two.jpeg\" width=\"700\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>In this blog post, I'll cover the base system, just one of the two nodes. Cluster testing is ongoing, and I'll cover things like AI model training and networking more in depth next year, likely with comparisons to the <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms\">Framework Desktop cluster</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/15-tb-vram-on-mac-studio-rdma-over-thunderbolt-5\">Mac Studio cluster</a> I've also been testing.</p>\n<p>But many of the same caveats of the DGX Spark (namely, price to performance is not great if you just want to run LLMs on a small desktop) apply to Dell's GB10 box as well.</p>",
