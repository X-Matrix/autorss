  "summary": "In an earlier post I presented a naive model for estimating Dutch electrical solar power generation numbers. It turns out that the Dutch electrical power generation numbers are an even bigger mess than I appreciated.\nIt appears that &ldquo;everyone knows&rdquo; that the numbers are confusing, incomplete and perhaps even wrong. But somehow this state of confusion isn&rsquo;t written down anywhere.\nSo I&rsquo;ll give it a shot.\nA round of thanks to a small number of anonymous industry insiders that provided invaluable help!",
