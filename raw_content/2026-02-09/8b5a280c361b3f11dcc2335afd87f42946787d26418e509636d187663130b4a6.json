  "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch\">Vouch</a></strong></p>\nMitchell Hashimoto's new system to help address the deluge of worthless AI-generated PRs faced by open source projects now that the friction involved in contributing has dropped so low.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/2020252149117313349\">He says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea is simple: Unvouched users can't contribute to your projects. Very bad users can be explicitly \"denounced\", effectively blocked. Users are vouched or denounced by contributors via GitHub issue or discussion comments or via the CLI.</p>\n<p>Integration into GitHub is as simple as adopting the published GitHub actions. Done. Additionally, the system itself is generic to forges and not tied to GitHub in any way.</p>\n<p>Who and how someone is vouched or denounced is up to the project. I'm not the value police for the world. Decide for yourself what works for your project and your community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/open-source\">open-source</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/github-actions\">github-actions</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/mitchell-hashimoto\">mitchell-hashimoto</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a></p>",
