  "summary": "<p>Aaron “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/wsj-tech-layoffs\">Homeboy</a>” Tilley and Wayne Ma, reporting for The Information (paywalled, alas, and with a miserly gift-link policy):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But there are also potential risks to making Federighi head of AI.\nGiving oversight of AI to him reflects Apple’s cautious approach\nto the technology. He is known at Apple as a penny-pincher who\nkeeps a tight rein on salaries and hesitates to invest in risky\nprojects when the payoff from them isn’t clear, according to\npeople who have worked with him. He tends to scrutinize every\ndetail of his team’s expenses, down to their budgets for bananas\nand other office snacks, those people said.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Apple’s rivals are pouring vast amounts of capital into\nAI, building data centers and paying fortunes to woo AI\nresearchers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have no idea what Federighi’s stance is on break-room bananas, but it seems a stretch to think it offers clues to Apple’s strategy on data centers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For years, lieutenants of Federighi would try to get him on board\nwith AI. He often shot those efforts down, former Apple executives\nsaid. For example, he rejected proposals from his team to use AI\nto dynamically change the iPhone home screen, believing it would\ndisorient users, who are used to knowing where their apps are\nlocated, said former Apple employees familiar with the proposal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jesus H. Christ, thank god Federighi shot this down. I wouldn’t want <em>good</em> AI rearranging my home screen behind my back, let alone Apple Intelligence as we know it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/22/information-federighi\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘The Information: ‘With Google Deal, Apple’s Craig Federighi Plots a Cautious Course in AI’’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
