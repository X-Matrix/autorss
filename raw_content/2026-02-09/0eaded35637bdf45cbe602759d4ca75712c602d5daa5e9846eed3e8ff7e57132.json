  "summary": "A very happy holiday season and Merry Christmas to those of you who celebrate it (timezone may vary). Also, I don't think I nearly say thanks enough to my regular patrons through Ko-fi, and I want to also thank them on behalf of the geriatric systems their generosity &mdash; and all of you who have chipped in at one time or another &mdash; helps keep running. I've got more projects to finish in 2026 and I hope you enjoy them.\n<p>\nAnyway, here's a gift for <em>you</em> which I forgot I still had kicking around. This is a raw cut from the 2007 Computer History Museum 25th anniversary symposium of the Commodore 64, with Jack Tramiel himself, plus Steve Wozniak, William Lowe and others (like Lee Felsenstein and Al Alcorn from the audience). I was fortunate enough to get into what was a sell-out standing-room only crowd with my trusty JVC DV camera and tape the whole thing, then dash back to So Cal and quickly dump and title it on the Power Mac Quad G5. Any camera glitches, plus a couple dropouts where I had to quickly change DV tapes, and bad titles are of course totally my fault. (In fact, there are indeed at least two errors. Can you find them?) This video is so old that it was actually originally uploaded to Google Video &mdash; some of you may remember it &mdash; and had been quietly transferred automatically to YouTube, which I had forgotten even happened. So here it is in its original strictly standard definition format. If you want to use clips from it in your own video, please give me a holler first in the comments. Enjoy.\n<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>",
