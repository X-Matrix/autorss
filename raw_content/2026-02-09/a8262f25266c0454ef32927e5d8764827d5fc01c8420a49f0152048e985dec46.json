  "summary": "This article is part of a series on (European) innovation and capabilities.\nEarlier this year I was very happy to be interviewed by Thomas Ramge for Germany&rsquo;s Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation (SPRIND). Many podcasts are just two guys talking to each other, but here Thomas brought along a lot of expertise &amp; spent serious time preparing, which contributed hugely to having a productive conversation.
