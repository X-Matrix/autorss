  "summary": "I&rsquo;ve recently been spending quite some time on the EU&rsquo;s Galileo Navigation Satellite System. In this post you&rsquo;ll find some rough notes on things I&rsquo;ve found out, both about how to receive data &amp; how to understand the Galileo ephemeris parameters.\nFeedback is very welcome on bert@hubertnet.nl or @bert_hu_bert! I&rsquo;m no Galileo specialist, so I am sure this page could be better. Please also let me know if this page has been useful to you.",
