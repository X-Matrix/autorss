  "summary": "This post is dedicated to the memory of Niklaus Wirth, a computing pioneer who passed away January 1st. In 1995 he wrote an influential article called &ldquo;A Plea for Lean Software&rdquo;, and in what follows, I try to make the same case nearly 30 years later, updated for today&rsquo;s computing horrors.\nThe really short version: the way we build/ship software these days is mostly ridiculous, leading to 350MB packages that draw graphs, and simple products importing 1600 dependencies of unknown provenance.",
