  "summary": "<p>With the death of Twitter, and the fracturing of social media, I&rsquo;m going to try an experiment! To that end, I&rsquo;m going post some of the more interesting things I&rsquo;ve read online each Thursday. I hope you find them interesting too. Or not, I don&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;m just going to keep doing it anyway.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll post links in no particular order, and they might not be recent. Just things I&rsquo;ve found interesting in the previous week or so.</p>",
