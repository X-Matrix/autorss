  "summary": "DNA: The Code of Life At the most magical SHA2017 gathering I gave two presentations, “DNA: The Code of Life” and the followup, “DNA: More greatest hits” (slides). The first presentation was recorded by the wonderful CCC C3VOC streaming crew, the second one by my friend Bart Smit (who is also wonderful). Without making this post too long, I want to thank everyone who helped me do this presentation — a lot of people contributed time, advice, recording abilities, great questions and enthusiasm.",
