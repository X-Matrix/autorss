  "summary": "tl;dr: A meandering talk that reminds us of the risks of shipping unknown build time dependencies (as from npm), and also highlights how many services now have runtime third party service dependencies. These are very serious choices about the future of a project, and we can wonder how well we are making these choices. Is anyone thinking about the long term costs and impact? The talk then covers &ldquo;microstacks&rdquo;, whereby a project relies in a minimal number of build dependencies, and no runtime service dependencies.",
