  "summary": "All BNT162b2 vaccine data on this page is sourced from this World Health Organization document.\nThis is a living page, shared already so people can get going! But check back frequently for updates.\nTranslation: Français / 日本語\nIn short: the vaccine mRNA has been optimized by the manufacturer by changing bits of RNA from (say) UUU to UUC, and people would like to understand the logic behind these changes. This challenge is quite close to what cryptologists and reverse engineering people encounter regularly.",
