  "summary": "<p>A theme of the last few books I&rsquo;ve read has been user testing. Specifically, that it is completely unreasonable to suggest that you could produce a system that will work smoothly in production without first getting several actual human users unfamiliar with your system, from your clients or in a related industry, to road-test the system.</p>\n<p>I think anyone can see that this is a good idea. It&rsquo;s far too easy to make assumptions about the users&rsquo; requirements or use cases. Without user testing software would rarely solve the problems it was designed for.</p>",
