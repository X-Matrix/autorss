  "summary": "<p>My thanks to Meh for sponsoring last week at DF. Meh puts up a new deal every day, and they do it with panache. As they say, “It’s actual, real, weird shit you didn’t know existed for half the price you would’ve guessed.”</p>\n\n<p>Don’t tell any of my other sponsors, but <a href=\"https://meh.com/go/df\">Meh</a> is my favorite <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">longtime DF sponsor</a>. I love the way their orange graphics look against DF’s <code>#4a525a</code> background. And I always love their sponsored posts that go into the RSS feed at the start of the sponsorship week. I’ll just quote theirs from this week in full:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Everything sucks. The whole world’s going to shit, especially our\npart of it, and it can feel like anything fun or silly is sticking\nyour head in the sand.</p>\n\n<p>And yet. It doesn’t help to just be miserable. If you’re going to\nlast, you’ve got to find your little moments of joy, or as a break\nfrom the misery.</p>\n\n<p>Buying our crap at Meh is not how you solve the world’s problems.\nWe’re not that crass. But maybe a minute a day of reading our\nlittle write-up, and a couple minutes of catching up with the Meh\ncommunity, of making a few new online friends, and yes, of\noccasionally picking up a weird gadget or strange snack you’ve\nnever heard of is just a few minutes you get to take a break, not\ngiving in to how bad everything else is.</p>\n\n<p>Of course we would say that. Of course we benefit from that.\nBut it is also part of why we have a quirky write-up. Why we\nhave a community. Why we’re selling whatever weird thing is\nover at Meh today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/25/meh\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Meh’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
