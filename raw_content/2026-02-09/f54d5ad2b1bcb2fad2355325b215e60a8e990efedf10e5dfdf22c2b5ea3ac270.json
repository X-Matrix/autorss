  "summary": "So as a bit of a followup to my earlier post &ldquo;What we in the open world are messing up in trying to compete with big tech &rdquo;: please (mostly) stop harassing people doing the right thing from the wrong platforms.\nWe often see journalists, politicians, writers, NGOs and even software developers writing good things on independence from (US) big tech proprietary platforms.
