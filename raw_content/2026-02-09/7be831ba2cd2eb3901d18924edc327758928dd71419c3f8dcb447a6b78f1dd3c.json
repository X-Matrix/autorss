  "summary": "<p>It has been an issue for a long time to run Docker images on multiple architectures. I remember the first time I got the idea to install Docker on my Raspberry Pi and I realized quickly that what I was trying to do would not work. The issue of course was that I was trying to use an AMD64 compiled Docker image on a ARM 32 bit CPU. Anyone who works with any lower level languages would call me an idiot for realizing this sooner than later. I would agree with them. Docker just seems to work like magic, running on most machines without any issue, like running Linux containers on Windows. One thing that has not been easy though is building Docker images on one type of CPU and running them on another.</p>",
