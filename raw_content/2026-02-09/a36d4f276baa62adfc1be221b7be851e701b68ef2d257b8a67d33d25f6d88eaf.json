  "summary": "We get tons of articles and reports explaining why people just voted like that. However, even for specific elections, these explanations are wildly inconsistent and can&rsquo;t all be true. In essence, we don&rsquo;t understand it and we don&rsquo;t get it. We reasonable people (who care about democracy, rule of law, human rights etc) stand no chance at all to improve things if we don&rsquo;t understand what is going on, or where people are getting their (dis)information from.",
