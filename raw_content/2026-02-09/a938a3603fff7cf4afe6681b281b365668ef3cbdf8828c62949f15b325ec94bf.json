  "summary": "<p>A couple of months ago, I received a <a href=\"https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microdot/issues/321\">request</a> from a random Internet user to add <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery\">CSRF</a> protection to my little web framework <a href=\"https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microdot\">Microdot</a>, and I thought it was a fantastic idea.</p>\n<p>When I set off to do this work in early November I expected I was going to have to deal with anti-CSRF tokens, double-submit cookies and hidden form fields, pretty much the traditional elements that we have used to build a defense against CSRF for years. And I did start along this tedious route. But then I bumped into a new way some people are dealing with CSRF attacks that is way simpler, which I describe below.</p>",
