  "summary": "In short, led by Denmark, many EU member states are arguing for forcing WhatsApp/Signal/etc to inspect all our photos and links, using AI. If the AI is in any &ldquo;doubt&rdquo; if this might be child pornography, your photo, location, phone number &amp; other details get reported to a new &ldquo;EU Centre&rdquo; and thence to Europol and a local police force.\nWhat happens next is not specified, but your holiday in Cyprus might end up with you having to explain your photos over at the local police station.",
