  "summary": "<p>\n  A version of my CSS Fizz Buzz that uses ordered list\n  (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>) to reduce code.  However, I don't quite\n  like how misaligned the numbers and the words look.  Correcting that\n  would call for extra code that would cancel out the bytes saved.\n</p>\n<!-- ### -->\n<p>\n  <a href=\"https://susam.net/code/web/css-fizz-buzz-ol.html\">Read on website</a> |\n  <a href=\"https://susam.net/tag/web.html\">#web</a>\n</p>",
