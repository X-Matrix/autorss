  "summary": "<p>Violet Jira, reporting for NOTUS:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The White House communications team <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/2014365986388951194?s=20\">posted a digitally altered\nphoto of Nekima Levy Armstrong,</a> a Minnesota social\njustice activist, on Thursday that makes it appear that she was\nweeping <a href=\"https://www.notus.org/immigration/pam-bondi-arrest-minneapolis-church-protesters-ice\">during her arrest by federal agents</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The image is highly realistic, bearing no watermark or other\nindicator that the image has been doctored. The change is only\napparent when compared to a <a href=\"https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/2014357826081071513?s=20\">different version of the same image\nposted by the Department of Homeland Security</a> earlier in\nthe day.</p>\n\n<p>The White House, which has adopted a combative, flippant tone on\nits widely viewed social media pages, drew some backlash for the\npost online. In response, White House deputy communications\ndirector Kaelan Dorr called the image a “meme.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s not a meme. It’s propaganda — an altogether false image presented as an actual photograph.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/22/trump-admin-doctored-images\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Trump Administration Shares Doctored Photo of Minnesota Activist After Her Arrest’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
