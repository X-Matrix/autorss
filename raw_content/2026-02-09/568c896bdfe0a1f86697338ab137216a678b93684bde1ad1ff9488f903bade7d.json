  "summary": "Position, velocity and time (PVT) information can be a &rsquo;nice to have&rsquo;, but in other circumstances knowing place and time has legal or military importance as well. Heavy vehicles for example are typically outfitted with tachographs that track driver speed and/or location. This has importance for rest regulations, but also to check if loads are actually from where they say they are.\nOur Global Navigation Satellite Systems so far are broadcasting unauthenticated data, at least to civilian users.",
