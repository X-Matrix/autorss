  "summary": "<p>Mark Gurman, reporting at Bloomberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Inc. has expanded the job of hardware chief John Ternus to\ninclude design work, solidifying his status as a leading contender\nto eventually succeed Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook.</p>\n\n<p>Cook, who has led Apple since 2011 and turned 65 in November,\nquietly tapped Ternus to manage the company’s design teams at the\nend of last year, according to people with knowledge of the\nmatter. That widens Ternus’ role to add one of the company’s most\ncritical functions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/2014413622294790610\">And on Twitter/X</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ternus is now the “executive sponsor” of Apple’s design team,\nrepresenting the critical function on Apple’s executive team. The\nmove was under-the-radar: on paper, the teams report to Tim Cook\ndespite Ternus’s role.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s to hoping Ternus is as pissed as the rest of us are about MacOS 26 Tahoe.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/22/ternus-design-apple\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Ternus Now Overseeing Design at Apple, Reports Gurman’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
