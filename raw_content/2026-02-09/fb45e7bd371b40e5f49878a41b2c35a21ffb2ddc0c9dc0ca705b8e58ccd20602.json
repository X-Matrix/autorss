  "summary": "<p>\n  QuickQWERTY 1.2.1 is now available.  QuickQWERTY is a web-based\n  touch typing tutor for QWERTY keyboards that runs directly in the\n  web browser.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This release contains a minor bug fix in Unit 4.3.  Unit 4.3 is a\n  'Control' unit that lets you practise typing partial words as well\n  as full words.  In one place in this unit, the following sequence of\n  partial and full words occurs:\n</p>\n<pre><code>l li lime lime</code></pre>\n<p>\n  The full word <code>lime</code> was incorrectly repeated twice.\n  This has been fixed to:\n</p>\n<pre><code>l li lim lime</code></pre>\n<p>\n  To try out QuickQWERTY, go to\n  <a href=\"../../../quickqwerty.html\">quickqwerty.html</a>.\n</p>\n<!-- ### -->\n<p>\n  <a href=\"https://susam.net/code/news/quickqwerty/1.2.1.html\">Read on website</a> |\n  <a href=\"https://susam.net/tag/web.html\">#web</a> |\n  <a href=\"https://susam.net/tag/programming.html\">#programming</a>\n</p>",
