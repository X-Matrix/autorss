  "summary": "<p>August and September. Google unveiled the Pixel 10 in August. Now it's September, it is Apple’s turn with the iPhone 17.</p>\n\n<p>These are not commercials. These are productions. Hollywood gloss, cinematic light. </p>\n\n<p>Jimmy Fallon laughing on cue. Job titles growing longer by the year. Influencers, celebrities, and everywhere you look: Gemini, Gemini, Gemini.</p>\n\n<p>Then Tim Cook, measured, polished. Apple the first, Apple the next. Don’t bother with Netflix &amp; Chill. Just tune in to the event with your date. Apple Intelligence, still missing in action.</p>\n\n<p>But then, the phone is in your hand. You set it up. You sign in. The apps and data return like old furniture. You try the new camera. Three test shots of your living room.</p>\n\n<p>Right then, a notification blinks. Framed by the beautiful liquid glass is a newsletter you never unsubscribed from. Your friend’s. It's been years, and they aren't giving up on their recipe website despite Google now conveniently framing it behind AI overview.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iugDMyJUoc0\">August is September</a>. You are where you began.</p>",
