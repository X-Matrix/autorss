  "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://wise.com\">Wise</a> has stolen more than $60,000 AUD from us, and refuses to let us access it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://secretlab.games\">We&rsquo;ve</a> had a Wise account for around 5 years (since they were called TransferWise). It&rsquo;s been a really useful way to transact in foreign currencies, and pay for things when we&rsquo;re travelling for work.</p>\n<p>In early-April 2025, Wise asked us to provide some additional information on our Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) by uploading a statement of shareholders, and the ID of the owners. Perfectly reasonable stuff for an entity that pretends to be a bank to ask for.</p>",
