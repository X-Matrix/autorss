  "summary": "<p>Last week I facilitated a session at <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/eXtreme-Tuesday-Club-XTC/\">XTC</a>, where we discussed the new product development framework from Basecamp, <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup\">Shape Up</a>, led by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomasankcorn\">Thomas Ankorn</a>.</p>\n<p>It was a really interesting discussion with people exploring the ideas openly, guided by questions posed by Thomas to get the conversation started.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve summarised the points that came up in the discussion, reconstructed from memory and the collected post-its of scribbles at the end of the evening.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-what-problems-does-this-solve\">1. What problems does this solve?</h3>\n<p>We started by looking at the positives of the framework, trying to identify strengths that would help mitigate problems we have encountered in our own teams.</p>",
