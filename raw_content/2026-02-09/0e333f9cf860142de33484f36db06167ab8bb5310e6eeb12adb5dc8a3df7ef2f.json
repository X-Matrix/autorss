It has an 8-core RISC-V processor, the ESWIN 7702X—not your typical AMD, Intel, or even <em>Arm</em> SoC. The full laptop version I tested <a href=\"https://store.deepcomputing.io/products/dc-roma-ai-pc-risc-v-mainboard-ii-for-framework-laptop-13?variant=50950609895588\">costs $1119</a> and gets you about the performance of a Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<p>A Pi 4—the one that came out in 2019.</p>\n<p>But unlike the Pi 4, this eats up 25 watts of power at idle, meaning the poor battery only lasts 2-3 hours.</p>",
