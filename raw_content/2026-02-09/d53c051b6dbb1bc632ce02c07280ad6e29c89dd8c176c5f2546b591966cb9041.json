  "summary": "<p>There are a bunch of blog posts and tutorials out there showing how to setup a\nstatic website on AWS. They all offer the same general solution with maybe some\ncaveat. Route53 for DNS, CloudFront as a CDN to speed up content delivery, S3\nto store the content, and ACM as a certificate provider. A good place to start\noff at when embarking on a new project is AWS own reference documentation.\n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/\">AWS static website project</a>\nis a great example of this, and it will probably do a better job conveying the\nrequired information that I ever will. The only thing I think the example lacks\nis setting up it certificates for CloudFront. That was the source of most of my\nproblems when setting up my static website, the very one you are on right now.\nThere are many Stack Overflow questions and additional blog posts trying to\nsolve these issues, but they are either just partially correct or outdated.\nThat is why I am going to highlight some common issues rather than a tutorial,\nbecause a better one already exists.</p>",
