  "summary": "<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>I've been getting burnt out on writing a weekly software essay. It's gone from taking me an afternoon to write a post to taking two or three days, and that's made it really difficult to get other writing done. That, plus some short-term work and life priorities, means now feels like a good time for a break. </p>\n<p>So I'm taking off from <em>Computer Things</em> for the rest of the year. There <em>might</em> be some announcements and/or one or two short newsletters in the meantime but I won't be attempting a weekly cadence until 2026.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for reading!</p>\n<p>Hillel</p>",
