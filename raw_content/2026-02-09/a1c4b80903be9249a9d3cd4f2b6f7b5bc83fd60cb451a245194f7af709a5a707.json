  "summary": "I started using Rust in 2017, before the stabilisation of async/await. When it was stabilised I managed to avoid it for a few more years before it was time to grapple with it. It’s fair to say that async Rust is one of the hairiest parts of the language, not because the async model is poorly designed, but because of the inherent complexity of it in combination with Rust’s goals. There have been many blog post written about async and its perceived shortcomings, as well as excellent explainers and history lessons, mostly from withoutboats.",
