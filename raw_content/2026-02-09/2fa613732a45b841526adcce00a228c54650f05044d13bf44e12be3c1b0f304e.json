  "summary": "<p>I was reading the latest issue of the journal <em>Science</em>, and a paper mentioned the compound Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>.\nFor a moment, I thought my knowledge of the periodic table was slipping, since I couldn't remember the element Gr.\nIt turns out that <em>Gr</em> was supposed to be <em>Ge</em>, germanium, but that raises two issues.\nFirst, shouldn't the peer reviewers and proofreaders at a top journal catch this error?\nBut more curiously, it appears that this formula is a mistake that has been copied around several times.</p>\n<p>The <em>Science</em> paper [1] states, \"Intrinsic ferromagnetism in these materials was discovered in Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub> down to the bilayer and monolayer thickness limit in 2017.\"\nI checked the referenced paper [2] and verified that the correct compound is Cr<sub>2</sub><strong>Ge</strong><sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>, with Ge for germanium.</p>\n<p>But in the process, I found more publications that <em>specifically</em> mention the 2017 discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in both Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub>.\nA 2021 paper in <em>Nanoscale</em> [3] says,\n\"Since the discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in atomically thin Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub> in 2017, research on two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials has become a highlighted topic.\"\nThen, a 2023 book chaper [4] opens with the abstract: \"Since the discovery of intrinsic long-range magnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) layered magnets, e.g., Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub> in 2017, [...]\"</p>\n<p>This illustrates how easy it is for a random phrase to get copied around with nobody checking it.\n(Earlier, I found a <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2019/10/how-special-register-groups-invaded.html\">bogus computer definition</a> that has persisted for over 50 years.)\nTo be sure, these could all be independent typos&mdash;it's an easy typo to make since G<strong>e</strong> and G<strong>r</strong> are neighbors on the keyboard and Cr2Gr2 scans better than Cr2Ge2.\nA few other papers [5, 6, 7] have the same typo, but in different contexts.\nMy bigger concern is that once AI picks up the erroneous formula,\nit will propagate as misinformation forever.\nI hope that by calling out this error, I can bring an end to it.\nIn any case, if anyone ends up here after a web search, I can at least confirm that\nthere isn't a new element Gr and\nthe real compound is Cr<sub>2</sub><strong>Ge</strong><sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>, chromium germanium telluride.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/gr/cr2ge2te6.jpg\"><img alt=\"A shiny crystal of Cr2Ge2Te6, about 5mm across.
