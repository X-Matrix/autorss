  "summary": "TLDR; You can find the project repository here.\nWhat? How? Why? A few Christmases ago, I was browsing the source code for the esp-idf heap allocator1 and thought:\nThis is quite interesting, I should write my own allocator\nAfter a bit of looking around, I discovered that general purpose heap allocators are one of those problems that has no perfect solution (which is the kind of problem I really enjoy).
