  "summary": "Don&rsquo;t take this too seriously. As part of my coping mechanisms, I try to understand the latest (Dutch) COVID-19 figures. I documented where to get the raw data and what they mean in an earlier post.\nPlease note I am not trying to make any kind of point with this data, not positive, not negative. I have no agenda, please do not read this as me trying to argue things aren&rsquo;t that bad or that they are terrible.",
