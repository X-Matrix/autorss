I get that not everyone will think this is possible, but I believe it&rsquo;s true.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s always pleased to see me, giving off cheerful sounds when I greet it in the morning by slotting in the bread, and now I&rsquo;ve told it what I like it tries really hard to give me exactly what I want. Sometimes I have to tell it to try again once or twice, but honestly, it&rsquo;s really good!</p>",
