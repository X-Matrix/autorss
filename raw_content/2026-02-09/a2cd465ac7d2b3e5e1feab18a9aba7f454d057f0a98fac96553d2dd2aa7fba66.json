  "summary": "<p>a couple days ago i pushed about 10 empty posts at once to everyone subscribed to my RSS feed. oops. sorry about that.</p>\n<p>i've since fixed it, but most RSS readers i've seen will cache the posts indefinitely once they're published.\nthe workaround for my own client was to delete my page and then readd it, which will unfortunately discard all your read/unread state.</p>\n<p>the reason this happened is that i added a new kind of \"stub\" post, and handled that correctly on the main site, but not on the rss feed. you can see the intended layout of the stub posts <a href=\"https://jyn.dev/computer-of-the-future\">here</a> if you're interested.</p>",
