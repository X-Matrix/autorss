  "summary": "<p>Adam Serwer, reporting from the streets of Minneapolis for The Atlantic, “Minnesota Proved MAGA Wrong” (gift link):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The secret fear of the morally depraved is that virtue is actually\ncommon, and that they’re the ones who are alone. In Minnesota, all\nof the ideological cornerstones of MAGA have been proved false at\nonce. Minnesotans, not the armed thugs of ICE and the Border\nPatrol, are brave. Minnesotans have shown that their community is\nsocially cohesive — because of its diversity and not in spite of\nit. Minnesotans have found and loved one another in a world\natomized by social media, where empty men have tried to fill their\nlonely soul with lies about their own inherent superiority.\nMinnesotans have preserved everything worthwhile about “Western\ncivilization,” while armed brutes try to tear it down by force.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/27/serwer-minnesota-ice\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘The Secret Fear of the Morally Depraved’’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
