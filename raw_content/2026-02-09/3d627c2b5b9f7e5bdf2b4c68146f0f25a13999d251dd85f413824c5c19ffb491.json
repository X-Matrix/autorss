  "summary": "<p>After 16 years on the LAMP stack, I finished <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/migrated-to-hugo/\">migrating this website from Drupal to Hugo</a> a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>What's old is new, as this blog was <em>originally</em> built with <a href=\"https://github.com/hyphanet/Thingamablog-Freenet\">Thingamablog</a>, a Java-based Static Site Generator (SSG) I ran on my Mac to generate HTML and FTP it up to my first webserver (over 20 years ago!).</p>\n<p>The main reason I moved from an SSG to Drupal was to add <em>comments</em>. I wanted my blog to have the same level of interactivity I had pre-Thingamablog, when I was (briefly) on Xanga.com.</p>",
