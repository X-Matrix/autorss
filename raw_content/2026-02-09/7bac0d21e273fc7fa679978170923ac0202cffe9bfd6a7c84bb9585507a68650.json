As input we have something like Fri, 17 Jan 2025 06:07:07 in UTC, and we&rsquo;d like to turn this into 1737094027, the notional (but not actual) number of seconds that have passed since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.\nTrying to figure this out led me to discover many &lsquo;surprise features&rsquo; and otherwise unexpected behaviour of POSIX time handling functions as implemented in various C libraries &amp; the languages that build on them.",
