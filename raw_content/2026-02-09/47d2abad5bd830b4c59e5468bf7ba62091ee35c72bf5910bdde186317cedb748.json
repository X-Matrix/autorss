  "summary": "Welcome back! In part 1 I discussed how std::string and std::vector interoperate with C, including with the C standard library qsort call. We also discovered that the C++ std::sort is 40% faster than C qsort because C++ is able to inline the comparison function.\nIn this part we continue with further C++ features that you can use to spice up your code &rsquo;line by line&rsquo;, without immediately having to use all 1400 pages of &lsquo;The C++ Programming Language&rsquo;.",
