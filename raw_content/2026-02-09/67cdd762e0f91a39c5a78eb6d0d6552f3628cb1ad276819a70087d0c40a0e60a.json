  "summary": "By bert hubert / bert@hubertnet.nl\nIn this post I want to document some mostly non-technical aspects of the EU&rsquo;s Galileo Satellite Navigation Network. I will also share some observations on how things are going, and perhaps how they could be improved.\nNOTE: A shorter version of this article, focusing only on the July outage, can be found here.\nSince the week-long outage in July I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by Galileo and, together with a wonderful crew of developers, experts and receiver operators, have learned so much about what I now know are called &lsquo;Global Navigation Satellite Systems&rsquo; or GNSS.",
