  "summary": "<p>Dr. Drang:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For weeks — maybe months, time has been hard to judge this past\nyear — Trump has been telling us that he’s worked out deals with\npharmaceutical companies to lower their prices by several hundred\npercent. Commentators and comedians have pointed out that you\ncan’t reduce prices more than 100% and pretty much left it at\nthat, suggesting that Trump’s impossible numbers are due to\nignorance.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t get me wrong. Trump’s ignorance is nearly limitless — but\nonly nearly. I’ve always thought that he knew the right way to\ncalculate a price drop; he did it the wrong way so he could quote\na bigger number. And that came out in yesterday’s speech.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trump sophistry + math pedantry = Daring Fireball catnip.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/23/playing-the-percentages\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Playing the Percentages’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
