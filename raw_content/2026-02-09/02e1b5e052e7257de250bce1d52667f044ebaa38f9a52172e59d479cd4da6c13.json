  "summary": "And we&rsquo;re back! As noted in part 1 and part 2 I thought it might be possible that I had discovered something interesting in biology. Lacking an academic peer group, I had decided to use a series of blog posts to gather feedback and to keep myself honest.\nI&rsquo;m very pleased to report that this process worked! I just received word that Nature Scientific Data has formally accepted my paper &ldquo;SkewDB, a comprehensive database of GC and 10 other skews for over 30,000 chromosomes and plasmids&rdquo; for publication!",
