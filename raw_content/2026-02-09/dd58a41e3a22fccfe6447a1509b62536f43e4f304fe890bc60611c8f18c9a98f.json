  "summary": "<p>One of my favorite programming books is <a href=\"https://craftinginterpreters.com\"><em>Crafting Interpreters</em></a> by Bob Nystrom. It teaches you how to build a programming language from scratch. Along the way, you learn about text parsing, data structures, virtual machines, and several other skills that make you a stronger developer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"img-wrapper\">\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/crafting-interpreters-intro/crafting-interpreters.webp\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/crafting-interpreters-intro/crafting-interpreters.webp\" />\n </a>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I was re-reading the book recently and realized that its <a href=\"https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html\">introduction</a> is delightfully effective. Developers are <a href=\"https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/write-blog-posts-developers-read/#get-to-the-point\">terrible at writing introductions</a>, so it&rsquo;s worth studying what makes the <em>Crafting Interpreters</em> intro so compelling.</p>",
