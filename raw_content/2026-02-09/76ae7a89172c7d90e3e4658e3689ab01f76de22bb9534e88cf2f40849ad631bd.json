  "summary": "This article is part of a series on (European) innovation and capabilities. Feedback is very welcome on bert@hubertnet.nl. I&rsquo;d also like to thank the many proofreaders, but all mistakes remain mine!\nIn the world of (high) technology, Europe is exceptionally weak at innovating. There are many ways to explain how this came to be, and a lot of the discussion focuses on unfair business conditions and regulation. In this post however I want to talk about important cultural and social reasons that are at least part of the reason, and present some possible solutions.",
