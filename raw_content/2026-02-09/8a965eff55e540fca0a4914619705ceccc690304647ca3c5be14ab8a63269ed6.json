  "summary": "<p>Date and time management libraries in many programming languages are famously bad. <a href=\"https://dev.arie.bovenberg.net/blog/python-datetime-pitfalls/\">Python's datetime module</a> comes to mind as one of the best (worst?) examples, and so does <a href=\"https://fjolt.com/article/javascript-date-is-weird/\">JavaScript's Date class</a>. It feels like these libraries could not have been made worse on purpose, or so I thought until today, when I needed to implement some date calculations in a backup rotation script written in bash.</p>\n<p>So, if you wanted to learn how to perform date and time arithmetic in your bash scripts, you've come to the right place. Just don't blame me for the nightmares.</p>",
