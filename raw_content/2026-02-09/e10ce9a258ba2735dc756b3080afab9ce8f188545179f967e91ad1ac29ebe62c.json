  "summary": "A quick update - The European Commission and EU member states have been pondering, for years now, if they should force WhatsApp/Apple/Signal/Telegram to scan all our private messages for suspected child sexual abuse material (CSAM). For various reasons it is a horrendous idea to break end to end encryption in this likely highly ineffective way. Variations of the proposal have also included a mandate to perform such scanning of images using AI, and even to also read our text messages to see if we aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;grooming&rdquo; children.",
