  "summary": "<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Xcode 26.3 introduces support for agentic coding, a new way in Xcode for developers to build apps using coding agents such as Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex. With agentic coding, Xcode can work with greater autonomy toward a developer’s goals — from breaking down tasks to making decisions based on the project architecture and using built-in tools.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t know if this is super-duper interesting news, but I think it’s super-duper interesting that Apple saw the need to release this now, not at WWDC in June.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/03/xcode-ai-agentic-coding\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Xcode 26.3 ‘Unlocks the Power of Agentic Coding’’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
