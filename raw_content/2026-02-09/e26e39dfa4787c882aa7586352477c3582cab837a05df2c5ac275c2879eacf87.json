  "summary": "<p>Last week I went to a jobs event, recruiting for my company. I was there on my own, and recruiting is a pretty new experience for me, so I was kinda excited about it. The attendees were a mix of graduates, bootcampers, and a few more senior developers, but mostly the crowd were looking for their first or second job. I enjoy going out and talking to people about their experiences with software &ndash; I think breadth of knowledge is really valuable &ndash; so I found it interesting seeing what other people are looking for in a job. I&rsquo;ve only ever had one; maybe I&rsquo;ve aimed for all the wrong things!</p>",
