  "summary": "<p>When I'm searching for docs, 95% of the time a single example would suffice. Yet, 95% of the time I can't find one in any official source.</p>\n<p>It seems that by default formal technical documentation is targeted towards someone who's deeply immersed in the ecosystem. But many developers have to juggle a lot of &quot;worlds&quot; in their heads daily. When jumping between projects, languages and frameworks, it takes a considerable amount of mental energy to restore the context and understand what is going on.</p>\n<p>Consider this <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max\">example</a> from the Python 3 docs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>max(iterable, /, *, key=None)</code>\nReturn the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.... <em>[followed by 5 short paragraphs]</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You need to know quite a bit about Python in order to understand this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What <code>*</code> means in the function definition.</li>\n<li>What <code>/</code> means in the function definition.</li>\n<li>What's a &quot;positional-only parameter separator&quot;</li>\n<li>What's an iterable.</li>\n<li>What are keyword-only arguments.</li>\n<li>What <code>key</code> usually means.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then you have to read some text in order to understand what values you can pass and how to actually call the function.</p>\n<p>Granted, these are important details that can't be omitted for brevity. But I bet a lot of developers looked at that page simply because they needed to quickly find out how to pass a custom sorting function. This example would've quickly helped them:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-python\"><span class=\"hljs-built_in\">max</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">4</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">6</span>) <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># → 6</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">max</span>([<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">3</span>]) <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># → 3</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">max</span>([<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;x&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;y&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;abc&#x27;</span>],  key=<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">len</span>) <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># → &#x27;abc&#x27;</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">max</span>([]) <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">max</span>([], default=<span class=\"hljs-number\">5</span>) <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># → 5</span>\n</code></pre><p>Easy, right?</p>\n<p>One popular community-based project in the Clojure world is <a href=\"https://clojuredocs.org/\">clojuredocs.org</a>, a site where people contribute examples for built in functions. It's fantastic and, in my experience, indispensable in day-to-day coding. For example, check out the pages about <a href=\"https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/into\">into</a> or <a href=\"https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/spit\">spit</a> or <a href=\"https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map\">map</a>. Note that examples often include related functions, not only those in question. This increases the real-world usefulness and practicality.</p>\n<p>Since even major software projects rarely offer <a href=\"https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/\">4 distinct kinds of documentation</a>, I am often hesitant to click on a &quot;Documentation&quot; link. Chances are, it's a terse, difficult to read, automatically generated API reference. I often choose to find a tutorial, not because I need a walk-through, but because I need examples.</p>",
