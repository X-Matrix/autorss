  "summary": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A major brick-and-mortar store sold an Apple Gift Card that Apple seemingly took offence to, and locked out my entire Apple ID, effectively bricking my devices and my iCloud Account, Apple Developer ID, and everything associated with it, and I have no recourse. Can you help? Email paris AT paris.id.au (and read on for the details). ❤️</p>\n<p><strong>Update 14 December 2025:</strong> Someone from Executive Relations at Apple says they&rsquo;re looking into it. I hope this is true. They say they&rsquo;ll call me back tomorrow, on 15 December 2025. In the mean time, it&rsquo;s been covered by <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/13/buttfield-addison-apple-account\">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/12/13/locked-out-how-a-gift-card-purchase-destroyed-an-apple-account\">Apple Insider</a>, <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/12/13/locked-out-of-apple-account-due-to-gift-card/\">Michael Tsai</a>, and others, thanks folks! I&rsquo;ve received 100s of emails of support, and will reply to you all in time, thank you. Finger&rsquo;s crossed Apple calls back.</p>",
