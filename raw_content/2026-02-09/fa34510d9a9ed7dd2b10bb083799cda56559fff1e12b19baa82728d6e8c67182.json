  "summary": "<p>Have you ever argued with someone who is seriously good at debating? I have. It sucks.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re constantly thrown off-balance, responding to a point you didn&rsquo;t expect to. You find yourself defending the weak edges of your argument, while the main thrust gets left behind in the back-and-forth, and you end up losing momentum, confidence, and ultimately, the argument.</p>\n<p>One of my close friends won international debate competitions for fun while we were at university (he&rsquo;s now a successful criminal barrister), and he told me that the only trick in the book, once you boil it all down, is to make sure the conversation is framed in your terms. Once that happens, it&rsquo;s all over bar the shouting.</p>",
