  "summary": "On IP address encryption: security analysis with respect for privacy Frequently, privacy concerns and regulations get in the way of security analysis. I’m a big fan of privacy, but I’m also a big fan of security and preventing people from getting hacked. If you are hacked you have no privacy either.\nPer-customer/subscriber traces are extremely useful for researching the security of networks. Specifically, lists of DNS requests per IP address make spotting infected users or infected devices very easy, especially if you look at “yesterday’s traffic” and compare it to today’s threat intelligence.",
