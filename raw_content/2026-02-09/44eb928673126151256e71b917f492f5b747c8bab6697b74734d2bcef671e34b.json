  "summary": "<p>I used to stress a lot about the &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; of how I was using up all the minutes in my day. I&rsquo;d to cram in as much as possible into time. eg. read on a 10 minute train, write code in the half hour before bed, etc.</p>\n<p>While I stressed about it a lot, I never found that I did the &ldquo;10x&rdquo; things I read about that were supposed to emerge as a result of this extra &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo;. For example I have only finished one of the three side projects I started in 2016, despite promising myself that those wouldn&rsquo;t take long.</p>",
