  "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://www.sublimemerge.com/\">Sublime Merge</a> is a fantastic Git client. I’ve been using it for years, even after switching from Sublime Text to VS Code.</p>\n<p>VS Code has excellent built-in Git support, but I still prefer a dedicated app for staging files. Even when I used Neovim or Emacs (which has <a href=\"https://magit.vc/\">Magit</a>, arguably the best Git client), I stuck with a separate tool for this step. Why?</p>\n<p>Staging files is the last significant step in preparing a meaningful commit. It’s a moment for a preliminary self-review, an opportunity to catch issues before pushing changes. Doing this in the same editor where I’ve been writing code makes it harder to see things objectively. By the time I reach staging, I’ve been immersed in that view of the codebase for a while. A shift in presentation — simply by using a different app — helps me see the changes with fresh(er) eyes.</p>\n<p>For the same reason, I prefer native browser-based views on GitHub and GitLab when reviewing other people’s merge requests. I like keeping &quot;writing code&quot; and &quot;reading code&quot; as distinct experiences.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Sublime Merge\" src=\"https://img.exotext.com/1/VHtKbeYqlYW7IAlAgG4Hj.png\" /></p>",
