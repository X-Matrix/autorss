  "summary": "Trifecta is actual stand-alone software that you can use to paste and drag images to, for easy sharing. It has pained me for years that I had to use imgur for this purpose. Not only does imgur install lots of cookies and trackers on my browser, I also then force these onto the people that visit the images that I share. I checked out some existing solutions you could download, but I worry about their security.",
