  "summary": "Ten, twenty years ago customers over at large corporations would often ask me what hardware they&rsquo;d need to run my software. As software developers, we&rsquo;d tend to be rather blasé about such questions: &ldquo;whatever you have lying around!&rdquo;. If pressed, we&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;d need this much RAM and that much storage.\nWe thought we were doing our users a tremendous favor by being so flexible. Yet, customers were very much not happy with our responses.",
