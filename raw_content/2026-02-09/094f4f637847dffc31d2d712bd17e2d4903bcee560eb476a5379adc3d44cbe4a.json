For example, <a href=\"https://jgc.org\">John Graham-Cumming</a> blogged while he was the CTO of Cloudflare, so I count his <a href=\"https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=jgc.org\">personal blog</a> but not <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/author/john-graham-cumming/\">his posts to the Cloudflare company blog</a>.</p>",
