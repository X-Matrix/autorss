  "summary": "<p>I love science fiction in all forms, and I can't resist watching almost <em>any</em> sci-fi movie. So, I watch a lot of them. It's a bit annoying how &quot;sci-fi and fantasy&quot; became the standard pairing. In my eyes, these genres are exactly opposite. It's like grouping movies about horses with movies about cars. </p>\n<p>Anyway, here are some lesser-known science fiction movies that I recommend.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-man-from-earth/\">The Man From Earth</a></h2>\n<p>Can a bunch of people sitting in a room, talking, be great science fiction? Yes. (Pro top: do not watch the sequel.)</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/primer/\">Primer</a></h2>\n<p>The hardest time-travel story you can find in movie format. Shane Carruth is doing something truly different. Fun easter egg of sorts: there's a time-travel episode of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8741290/\">Tales From the Loop</a> (a brilliant little sci-fi series, too), and Shane Carruth appears in a cameo role which fits him so much.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/pandorum/\">Pandorum</a></h2>\n<p>It starts in a pretty banal setting of &quot;awaken in a spaceship, something happened, omg&quot;, but then goes into a very interesting direction. If <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/passengers-2016/\">Passengers</a> is a cheap airport novel, then Pandorum is its serious counterpart. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/upstream-color/\">Upstream Color</a></h2>\n<p>Another film by Shane Carruth. More approachable that Primer.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/coherence/\">Coherence</a></h2>\n<p>Don't you love it when reality bends?</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/timecrimes/\">Timecrimes</a> (Los cronocrímenes)</h2>\n<p>Who can resist a time-travel paradox? I guess there isn't anything ground-breaking, but damn it's a good film.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/prospect-2018/\">Prospect</a></h2>\n<p>One of those movies that doesn't bend your mind or change your world, but brings you to another universe for a couple of hours. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/vesper-2022/\">Vesper</a></h2>\n<p>I can pretty much copy the description from Prospect and paste here. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-artifice-girl/\">The Artifice Girl</a></h2>\n<p>Philosophical horror is probably the best way to describe this.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There are some good movies which come from big studios and are probably more known than the ones above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/moon/\">Moon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/gattaca/\">Gattaca</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/sunshine-2007/\">Sunshine</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/equilibrium/\">Equilibrium</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/children-of-men/\">Children of Men</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Here are some movies and TV-shows which I like mostly due to nostalgia. They are kinda trashy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/cube/\">Cube</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-langoliers/\">The Langoliers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112167/\">Sliders</a></li>\n</ul>",
