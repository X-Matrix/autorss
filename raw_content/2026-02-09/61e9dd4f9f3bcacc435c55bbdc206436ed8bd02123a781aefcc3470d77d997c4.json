  "summary": "<p>From the footer on the project’s website:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Moltbot was formerly known as Clawdbot. Independent project, not\naffiliated with Anthropic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Makes sense, to be honest, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/clawdbot-changes-name-moltbot-anthropic-trademark-2026-1\">that Anthropic would object</a> to naming it a homonym for Claude.</p>\n\n<p>One additional followup to <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/26/viticci-on-clawdbot\">my post the other day</a>. In his terrific introduction to <s>Clawd</s>Moltbot, <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/clawdbot-showed-me-what-the-future-of-personal-ai-assistants-looks-like/\">Federico Viticci wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’ve been playing around with Clawdbot so much, I’ve burned\nthrough 180 million tokens on the Anthropic API (<em>yikes</em>), and\nI’ve had fewer and fewer conversations with the “regular” Claude\nand ChatGPT apps in the process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those tokens aren’t free. I asked Viticci just how much “yikes” cost, and <a href=\"https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/115968901926545907\">he said</a> around US$560 — using way more input than output tokens.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/27/clawdbot-is-now-moltbot\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Clawdbot Is Now Moltbot’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
