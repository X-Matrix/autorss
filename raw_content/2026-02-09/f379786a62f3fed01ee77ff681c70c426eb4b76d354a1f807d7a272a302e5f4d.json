  "summary": "So this is likely the last time you see me blog about my new (part time) job.\nUpdate: I have left this post in September 2022\n(Nederlandse versie hier).\nStarting December 1st, I am one of the three members of the board that checks warrants for the Dutch intelligence and security services. This board is called &ldquo;Toetsingscommissie Inzet Bevoegdheden&rdquo; or TIB.\nIf either of the civil or the military intelligence and security services of The Netherlands want to use their lawful intercept, SIGINT or hacking (&amp; some other) legal powers, they have to first convince their own jurists, then their ministry and finally the TIB.",
