  "summary": "Hi everyone,\nAs noted previously I&rsquo;ve gone all in on GNSS monitoring. GNSS is the generic term for GPS, Galileo, GLONASS and BeiDou satellites.\nEventually a big blog post will come out, but meanwhile you can see the results on galmon.eu.\nA few days ago, an unknown GLONASS satellite started transmitting signals on slot R26 and I tried to figure out which one it was. By definition, GNSS satellites broadcast their own very precise location &amp; speed, which makes it possible to match up their orbit to published &ldquo;TLEs&rdquo;, which document where objects in space are.",
