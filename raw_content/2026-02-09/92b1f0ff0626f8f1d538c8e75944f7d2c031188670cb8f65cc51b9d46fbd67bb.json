  "summary": "TigerBeetle famously\nuses static allocation.\nInfamously, the use of the term is idiosyncratic: what is meant is not static arrays, as found\nin embedded development, but rather a weaker no allocation after startup form. The amount of\nmemory TigerBeetle process uses is not hard-coded into the Elf binary. It depends on the runtime\ncommand line arguments. However, all allocation happens at startup, and there's no deallocation. The\nlong-lived event loop goes round and round happily without alloc.",
