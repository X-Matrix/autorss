Even if AI writing improved dramatically tomorrow, fundamental problems would remain that no algorithm refinement can fix.</p>\n<p>The environmental cost alone should give us pause. Training <a href=\"https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume24/23-0069/23-0069.pdf\">even a small LLM produces carbon emissions equivalent to the output of several cars, over their entire lifetimes</a>, and each query consumes significant energy. <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2023-10-13/carbon-emissions-video-game-development-scope-3-climate-impact/102955178\">Game development already has a substantial carbon footprint</a>—why increase it when human writers remain perfectly capable?</p>",
