  "summary": "John Ousterhout, of TCL fame, has written a book that is as small (literally) as it is important. Weighing in at 178 none too big pages, it takes us on an inspired trip through what John has learned over the decades.\nThere is no shortage of thought on programming. There is also no shortage of people doing programming. What is rare however is a compendium of mature insights from someone that clearly still is into programming.",
