  "summary": "<p>The other day I was browsing YouTube — as one does — and I clicked a link in the video description to a book.</p>\n<p>I was then subjected to a man-in-the-middle attack, where YouTube put themselves in the middle of me and the link I had clicked:</p>\n<p class=\"image-container\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of a webpage that says “Are you sure you want to leave YouTube?” and there are two buttons. On the left is the secondary, de-emphasized button that says “GO TO SITE” and on the right is the primary, visually emphasized button that says “BACK TO YOUTUBE”.\" height=\"381\" src=\"https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2026/youtube-are-you-sure.png\" width=\"680\" />\n\n</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/the-subversive-hyperlink/\">Hyperlinks are subversive</a>. Big Tech must protect themselves and their interests.</p>\n<p>But link hijacking isn’t why I’m writing this post.</p>\n<p>What struck me was the ordering and visual emphasis of the “call to action” (CTA) buttons. I almost clicked “Back to YouTube”, which was precisely the action I didn’t want.</p>\n<p>I paused and laughed to myself.</p>\n<p>Look how the design pattern for primary/secondary user interface controls has inverted over time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic software:<ul>\n<li>Primary CTA: what’s best for you</li>\n<li>Secondary CTA: an alternative for you</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Modern software:<ul>\n<li>Primary CTA: what’s best for us</li>\n<li>Secondary CTA: what’s acceptable to us</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It seems like everywhere I go, software is increasingly designed <em>against</em> me.</p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/cta-hierarchy/\">Email</a>\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>",
