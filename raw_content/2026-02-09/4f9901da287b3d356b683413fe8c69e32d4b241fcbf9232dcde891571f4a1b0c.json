  "summary": "Here I collect for various (scientific) fields the absolutely most important books. Totemic Tomes if you will. Books you can&rsquo;t miss. Books that everyone in a field should have read, or belatedly discover they haven&rsquo;t yet. The book you wish you&rsquo;d known about before wading through several mediocre works.\n“I have always imagined that paradise will be a kind of library.” — Jorge Luis Borges\nMany of these books are still entirely relevant, but a few have been overtaken by new discoveries, but have however not relinquished their epic status.",
