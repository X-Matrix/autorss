  "summary": "Trifecta is a simple open source image sharing site, built with a combination of modern C++, database and web technologies. Intended to both be useful and make some points. This page sets out to explain the underlying technology of this small yet hopefully useful piece of software.\nMore background can be found on its main page, where you can also read a bit about why I built this software. In short, 1: I need an image sharing site I trust and that does not track its users and 2: I want to show that you can still run a service yourself safely.",
