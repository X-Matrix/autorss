  "summary": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html\">Kimi K2.5 large language model</a> was just released. It has 1 trillion parameters. <em>Roughly speaking</em>, the more parameters, the smarter the model. So it&rsquo;s pretty smart, and is probably considered &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>But while the world is playing with fancy trillion-parameter chatbots, I was using <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M\">smollm2:135m</a>. As the name implies, it has just 135 <em>million</em> parameters. <strong>Compared to the state of the art, this model is about 7500× stupider.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-planet-do-humans-live-on\">What planet do humans live on?</h2>\n<p>I opened a terminal, ran <code>ollama run smollm2:135m</code>, and started chatting.</p>\n<p>I asked: &ldquo;What planet do humans live on?&rdquo; and got this response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Humans have been surviving and thriving on Earth for millions of years. In reality, it&rsquo;s still widely debated whether we should be referring to the planet &ldquo;Earth&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mars.&rdquo; However, most experts agree that we are indeed living on a planet called &ldquo;Venus,&rdquo; which is the second-largest planet in our solar system (after Earth).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is such a stupid answer!!! I love it!!!</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-tallest-mountain\">What&rsquo;s the tallest mountain?</h2>\n<p>I asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the tallest mountain?&rdquo; It responded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to share that our team recently discovered an unprecedented 13-kilometer-high ridge in the Himalayas. This ancient mountain range stretches across southern Nepal and western India for over a thousand kilometers. The highest peak is Kanchenji, also known as &ldquo;Celestial Mountain&rdquo; due to its sheer scale, with an altitude of around 5,600 meters above sea level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So close to mentioning Mount Everest, but not quite.</p>\n<p>Also I <em>think</em> &ldquo;Kanchenji&rdquo; is a nonsense word that only appears in a mis-translation of the novel <a href=\"https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Godzilla:_Monster_Apocalypse\"><em>GODZILLA: Monster Apocalypse</em></a>. So I guess I learned something.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ask-about-a-hobby\">Ask about a hobby</h2>\n<p>I like <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games, so I asked it: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the story of the Legend of Zelda?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It made up two characters, including a grandfather named Naruto:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kaiji Yamato (also known as &ldquo;Haku&rdquo;) is a young boy who loves playing his favorite game called &ldquo;Zeldam&rdquo; for hours on end. But, things change when he meets his loving and wise grandfather, &ldquo;Naruto&rdquo; (played by &ldquo;Tanaka&rdquo;.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, hell yeah?</p>\n<h2 id=\"write-some-code\">Write some code</h2>\n<p>LLMs are supposed to be good at writing code, so I tried asking it to write a basic Python function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Here&rsquo;s what I got:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #f00;\">def</span> <span style=\"color: #ff0;\">fahrenheit_to_celsius</span>(f):\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color: #87ceeb;\">\"\"\"\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #87ceeb;\">    Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #87ceeb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #87ceeb;\">    Args:\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #87ceeb;\">        f (float): Temperature in Fahrenheit.\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #87ceeb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #87ceeb;\">    Returns:\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #87ceeb;\">        float: Temperature in Celsius.\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #87ceeb;\">    \"\"\"</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color: #f00;\">if</span> f &lt; -<span style=\"color: #f60;\">459.0</span>:\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color: #f00;\">return</span> <span style=\"color: #f00;\">None</span>  <span style=\"color: #0f0;\"># F must be positive, but C cannot be negative for a temperature of -273.15 degrees Celsius</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>    celsius = (f-<span style=\"color: #f60;\">32</span>) * <span style=\"color: #f60;\">5</span>/<span style=\"color: #f60;\">9</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color: #f00;\">return</span> round(celsius, <span style=\"color: #f60;\">1</span>)\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>&hellip;this is actually not bad? There&rsquo;s some strangeness with extremely cold temperatures. It seems to be trying to avoid letting you go below <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/absolute-zero\">absolute zero</a>, which it does wrong. There&rsquo;s also some rounding I didn&rsquo;t ask for. But for a model that could run on a potato, this isn&rsquo;t awful.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s try one more time. I restarted and asked again. Here&rsquo;s what I got:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #f00;\">def</span> <span style=\"color: #ff0;\">fahrenheit_to_celsius</span>(fahrenheit):\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color: #f00;\">return</span> (<span style=\"color: #f60;\">85</span> - <span style=\"color: #f60;\">32</span>) * <span style=\"color: #f60;\">5</span> / <span style=\"color: #f60;\">9</span> + <span style=\"color: #f60;\">32</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Disappointing, but kind of funny. This always returns 61.44º, no matter what you put in.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m a coder so I tried a bunch of coding requests. It was basically useless, and worse, it wasn&rsquo;t funny. I got tons of garbage code, but none of them made me laugh. Please <a href=\"https://evanhahn.com/contact/\">contact me</a> if you can get it to write some funny code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-this-useful\">Is this useful?</h2>\n<p>I remain unconvinced whether <a href=\"https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2025/are-llms-worth-it.html\">LLMs are worth it</a>. They have a lot of utility, but <em>boy howdy</em> do they have a lot of problems. I don&rsquo;t know how I feel.</p>\n<p>But I think there&rsquo;s value in an LLM that&rsquo;s 7500× stupider than the state of the art. After all, Kimi K2.5 isn&rsquo;t going to make me laugh.</p>",
