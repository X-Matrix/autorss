A floating-point coprocessor could be used with\n    the i486SX. This coprocessor, the 80487 (i487SX) was really a full 486 processor including floating point.\n\n-->\n\n<!--\nFor details on the Pentium's implementation, including the floating-point unit, see [Design of the Intel Pentium Processor](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1993.393370).\n-->\n\n<h2>Finding pi in the constant ROM</h2>\n<p>In binary, pi is <code>11.00100100001111110...</code> but what does this mean?\nTo interpret this, the value <code>11</code> to the left of the binary point is simply 3 in binary. (The \"binary point\" is the\nsame as a decimal point, except for binary.)\nThe digits to the right of the binary point have the values 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and so forth.\nThus, the binary value `11.001001000011... corresponds to 3 + 1/8 + 1/64 + 1/4096 + 1/8192 + ..., which matches the decimal value of pi.\nSince pi is irrational, the bit sequence is infinite and non-repeating; the value in the ROM is truncated to 67 bits\nand stored as a floating point number.</p>\n<p>A floating point number is represented by two parts: the exponent and the significand.\nFloating point numbers include very large numbers such as 6.02&times;10<sup>23</sup> and very small numbers such as 1.055×10<sup>−34</sup>.\nIn decimal, 6.02&times;10<sup>23</sup> has a significand (or mantissa) of 6.02, multiplied by a power of 10 with an exponent of 23.\nIn binary, a floating point number is represented similarly, with a significand and exponent, except the significand is multiplied by a power of 2 rather than 10.\nFor example, pi is represented in floating point as 1.1001001...&times;2<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>The diagram below shows how pi is encoded in the Pentium chip. Zooming in\nshows the constant ROM.\nZooming in on a small part of the ROM shows the rows of transistors that store the constants.\nThe arrows point to the transistors representing the bit sequence 11001001, where a 0 bit is represented by a transistor (vertical white line) and a 1 bit is\nrepresented by no transistor (solid dark silicon).\nEach magnified black rectangle at the bottom has two potential transistors, storing two bits.\nThe key point is that by looking at the pattern of stripes, we can determine the pattern of transistors and thus the value\nof each constant, pi in this case.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/pi-labeled.jpg\"><img alt=\"A portion of the floating-point ROM, showing the value of pi.

The two types have similar construction but reverse the\ndoping; NMOS uses n-type diffusion regions as shown below, while PMOS uses p-type diffusion regions.\nSince the two types are complementary (C),\ncircuits built with the two types of transistors are called CMOS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/mosfet.jpg\"><img alt=\"Structure of a MOSFET in an integrated circuit.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"234\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/mosfet-w400.jpg\" title=\"Structure of a MOSFET in an integrated circuit.\" width=\"400\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">Structure of a MOSFET in an integrated circuit.</div></p>\n<p>The image below shows how a transistor in the ROM looks under the microscope. \nThe pinkish regions are the doped silicon that forms the transistor's source and drain.\nThe vertical white line is the polysilicon that forms the transistor's gate.\nFor this photo, I removed the chip's three layers of metal, leaving just the underlying silicon and the polysilicon.\nThe circles in the source and drain are tungsten contacts that connect the silicon to the metal layer above.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/transistor.jpg\"><img alt=\"One transistor in the constant ROM.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"138\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/transistor-w300.jpg\" title=\"One transistor in the constant ROM.\" width=\"300\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">One transistor in the constant ROM.</div></p>\n<p>The diagram below shows eight bits of storage. Each of the four pink silicon rectangles has two potential transistors.\nIf a polysilicon gate crosses the silicon, a transistor is formed; otherwise there is no transistor.\nWhen a select line (horizontal polysilicon) is energized, it will turn on all the transistors in that row.\nIf a transistor is present, the corresponding ROM bit is 0 because the transistor will pull the output line to ground. If a transistor\nis absent, the ROM bit is 1.\nThus, the pattern of transistors determines the data stored in the ROM.\nThe ROM holds 26144 bits (304 words of 86 bits) so it has 26144 potential transistors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/rom-cells.jpg\"><img alt=\"Eight bits of storage in the ROM.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/rom-cells-w600.jpg\" title=\"Eight bits of storage in the ROM.\" width=\"600\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">Eight bits of storage in the ROM.</div></p>\n<!--\nx86 extended precision: 80 bits: sign, 15-bit exponent, 64-bit significand (mantissa).\nInternally, the floating-point unit performs calculations with a 68-bit significand for additional accuracy.\nThe registers hold 18 bits in the sign/exponent part and 68 bits in the significand part.\n-->\n\n<p>The photo below shows the bottom layer of metal (M1): vertical metal wires that provide the ROM outputs and\nsupply ground to the ROM.\n(These wires are represented by gray lines in the schematic above.)\nThe polysilicon transistors (or gaps as appropriate) are barely visible between the metal lines.\nMost of the small circles are tungsten contacts to the silicon or polysilicon; compare with the photo above.\nOther circles are tungsten vias to the metal layer on top (M2), horizontal wiring that I removed for this photo.\nThe smaller metal \"tabs\" act as jumpers between the horizontal metal select lines in M2 and the\npolysilicon select lines.\nThe top metal layer (M3, not visible) has thicker vertical wiring for the chip's primary distribution power and ground.\nThus, the three metal layers alternate between horizontal and vertical wiring, with vias between the layers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/rom-metal.jpg\"><img alt=\"A closeup of the ROM showing the bottom metal layer.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/rom-metal-w450.jpg\" title=\"A closeup of the ROM showing the bottom metal layer.\" width=\"450\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">A closeup of the ROM showing the bottom metal layer.</div></p>\n<p>The ROM is implemented as two grids of cells (below): one to hold exponents and one to hold significands, as shown below.\nThe exponent grid (on the left) has 38 rows and 144 columns of transistors, while the significand grid (on the right) has 38 rows and 544 columns.\nTo make the layout work better, each row holds eight different constants; the bits are interleaved so the ROM holds the first bit of eight constants,\nthen the second bit of eight constants, and so forth.\nThus, with 38 rows, the ROM holds 304 constants; each constant has 18 bits in the exponent part and 68 bits in the significand section.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/rom-overview-diagram.jpg\"><img alt=\"A diagram of the constant ROM and supporting circuitry.

That row provides 144+544 bits to the selection\ncircuitry above the ROM. \nThis circuitry has 86 multiplexers; each multiplexer selects one bit out of the group of 8, selecting the desired constant.\nThe significand bits flow into the floating-point unit datapath circuitry above the ROM.\nThe exponent circuitry, however, is in the upper-left corner of the floating-point unit, a considerable distance from the ROM, so the exponent bits travel through a bus to the exponent circuitry.</p>\n<p>The row select circuitry consists of gates to decode the row number, along with high-current drivers to energize\nthe selected row in the ROM.\nThe photo below shows a closeup of two row driver circuits, next to some ROM cells.\nAt the left, PMOS and NMOS transistors implement a gate to select the row. Next, larger NMOS and PMOS transistors form part of the driver.\nThe large square structures are bipolar NPN transistors; the Pentium is unusual because it uses both bipolar transistors and CMOS, a technique called BiCMOS.<span id=\"fnref:drivers\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:drivers\">4</a></span>\nEach driver occupies as much height as four rows of the ROM, so there are four drivers arranged horizontally;\nonly one is visible in the photo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/rom-drivers.jpg\"><img alt=\"ROM drivers implemented with BiCMOS.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"190\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/rom-drivers-w400.jpg\" title=\"ROM drivers implemented with BiCMOS.\" width=\"400\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">ROM drivers implemented with BiCMOS.</div></p>\n<h2>Structure of the floating-point unit</h2>\n<p>The floating-point unit is structured with data flowing vertically through horizontal functional units, as shown below.\nThe functional units&mdash;adders, shifters, registers, and comparators&mdash;are arranged in rows.\nThis collection of functional units with data flowing through them is called the <em>datapath</em>.<span id=\"fnref:integer\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:integer\">5</a></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/datapath.jpg\"><img alt=\"The datapath of the floating-point unit.

The ROM is at the bottom.\" width=\"300\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">The datapath of the floating-point unit. The ROM is at the bottom.</div></p>\n<p>Each functional unit is constructed from cells, one per bit, with the high-order bit on the left and the low-order bit on the right.\nEach cell has the same width&mdash;38.5 µm&mdash;so the functional units can be connected like Lego blocks snapping together, minimizing the wiring.\nThe height of a functional unit varies as needed, depending on the complexity of the circuit.\nFunctional units typically have 69 bits, but some are wider, so the edges of the datapath circuitry are ragged.</p>\n<p>This cell-based construction explains why the ROM has eight constants per row.\nA ROM bit requires a single transistor, which is much narrower than, say, an adder. Thus, putting one bit in each 38.5 µm cell would waste most of the space.\nCompacting the ROM bits into a narrow block would also be inefficient, requiring diagonal wiring to connect each ROM bit to the corresponding datapath bit.\nBy putting eight bits for eight different constants into each cell, the width of a ROM cell matches the rest of the datapath and the alignment of bits\nis preserved.\nThus, the layout of the ROM in silicon is dense, efficient, and matches the width of the rest of the floating-point unit.</p>\n<h2>Polynomial approximation: don't use a Taylor series</h2>\n<p>Now I'll move from the hardware to the constants.\nIf you look at the constant ROM contents in the appendix, you may notice that many constants are close to reciprocals or reciprocal factorials, but don't quite\nmatch. For instance, one constant is 0.1111111089, which is close to 1/9, but visibly wrong.\nAnother constant is almost 1/13! (factorial) but wrong by 0.1%. What's going on? </p>\n<p>The Pentium uses polynomials to approximate transcendental functions (sine, cosine, tangent, arctangent, and base-2 powers and logarithms).\nIntel's earlier floating-point units, from the 8087 to the 486, used an algorithm called CORDIC that generated results\na bit at a time.\nHowever, the Pentium takes advantage of its fast multiplier and larger ROM and uses polynomials instead,\ncomputing results two to three times faster than the 486 algorithm.</p>\n<p>You may recall from calculus that a Taylor series polynomial approximates a function near a point (typically 0).\nFor example, the equation below gives the Taylor series for sine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/taylor-equation.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"49\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/taylor-equation-w350.png\" title=\"\" width=\"350\" /></a><div class=\"cite\"></div></p>\n<!-- \\textnormal{sin}(x) = x - \\frac{x^3} {3!} + \\frac{x^5} {5!} - \\frac{x^7} {7!}  + \\frac{x^9} {9!} - ...\nhttps://latex2image.joeraut.com/\n-->\n\n<p>Using the five terms shown above generates a function that looks indistinguishable from sine in the graph below.\nHowever, it turns out that this approximation has too much error to be useful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/taylor4.jpg\"><img alt=\"Plot of the sine function and the Taylor series approximation.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/taylor4-w300.jpg\" title=\"Plot of the sine function and the Taylor series approximation.\" width=\"300\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">Plot of the sine function and the Taylor series approximation.</div></p>\n<p>The problem is that a Taylor series is very accurate near 0, but the error soars near the edges of the argument range, as shown in the graph on the left below.\nWhen implementing a function, we want the function to be accurate everywhere, not just close to 0, so the Taylor\nseries isn't good enough.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/sin-error-comparison.jpg\"><img alt=\"The absolute error for a Taylor-series approximation to sine (5 terms), over two different argument ranges.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"211\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/sin-error-comparison-w600.jpg\" title=\"The absolute error for a Taylor-series approximation to sine (5 terms), over two different argument ranges.\" width=\"600\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">The absolute error for a Taylor-series approximation to sine (5 terms), over two different argument ranges.</div></p>\n<p>One improvement is called range reduction: shrinking the argument to a smaller range so you're in the accurate flat part.<span id=\"fnref:range\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:range\">6</a></span>\nThe graph on the right looks at the Taylor series over the smaller range [-1/32, 1/32].\nThis decreases the error dramatically, by about 22 orders of magnitude (note the scale change).\nHowever, the error still shoots up at the edges of the range in exactly the same way.\nNo matter how much\nyou reduce the range, there is almost no error in the middle, but the edges have a lot of error.<span id=\"fnref:scaling\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:scaling\">7</a></span></p>\n<p>How can we get rid of the error near the edges? The trick is to tweak the coefficients of the Taylor series in a special way that\nwill increase the error in the middle, but decrease the error at the edges by much more.\nSince we want to minimize the maximum error across the range (called <em>minimax</em>), this tradeoff is beneficial.\nSpecifically, the coefficients can be optimized by a process called the Remez algorithm.<span id=\"fnref:remez\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:remez\">8</a></span>\nAs shown below, changing the coefficients by less than 1% dramatically improves the accuracy.\nThe optimized function (blue) has much lower error over the full range, so it is a much better approximation than the Taylor series (orange).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/taylor-error.png\"><img alt=\"Comparison of the absolute error from the Taylor series and a Remez-optimized polynomial, both with maximum term x9.

You get\na much better approximation by modifying the coefficients very slightly with the Remez algorithm. This explains\nwhy the coefficients in the ROM almost, but not quite, match a Taylor series.</p>\n<h3>Arctan</h3>\n<p>I'll now look at the Pentium's constants for different transcendental functions.\nThe constant ROM contains coefficients for two arctan polynomials, one for single precision and one\nfor double precision.\nThese polynomials almost match the Taylor series, but have been modified for accuracy.\nThe ROM also holds the values for <em>arctan(1/32)</em> through <em>arctan(32/32)</em>; the\nrange reduction process uses these constants with a trig identity to reduce the argument range to\n[-1/64, 1/64].<span id=\"fnref:atan\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:atan\">9</a></span>\nYou can see the arctan constants in the Appendix.</p>\n<p>The graph below shows the error for the Pentium's arctan polynomial (blue) versus the Taylor series of the same length (orange).\nThe\nPentium's polynomial is superior due to the Remez optimization.\nAlthough the Taylor series polynomial is much flatter in the middle, the error soars near the boundary.\nThe Pentium's polynomial wiggles more but it maintains a low error across the whole range.\nThe error in the Pentium polynomial blows up outside this range, but that doesn't matter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/arctan2-error.png\"><img alt=\"Comparison of the Pentium's double-precision arctan polynomial to the Taylor series.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/arctan2-error-w400.png\" title=\"Comparison of the Pentium's double-precision arctan polynomial to the Taylor series.\" width=\"400\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">Comparison of the Pentium's double-precision arctan polynomial to the Taylor series.</div></p>\n<h3>Trig functions</h3>\n<p>Sine and cosine each have two polynomial implementations, one with 4 terms in the ROM and one with 6 terms in\nthe ROM.\n(Note that coefficients of 1 are not stored in the ROM.)\nThe constant table also holds 16 constants such as <em>sin(36/64)</em> and <em>cos(18/64)</em> that are used for argument range reduction.<span id=\"fnref:sin\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:sin\">10</a></span>\nThe Pentium computes tangent by dividing the sine by the cosine.\nI'm not showing a graph because the Pentium's error came out worse than the Taylor series, so either I have an\nerror in a coefficient or I'm doing something wrong.</p>\n<h3>Exponential</h3>\n<p>The Pentium has an instruction to compute a power of two.<span id=\"fnref:exponential\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:exponential\">11</a></span>\nThere are two sets of polynomial coefficients for exponential, one with 6 terms in the ROM\nand one with 11 terms in the ROM.\nCuriously, the polynomials in the ROM compute <em>e<sup>x</sup></em>, not <em>2<sup>x</sup></em>.\nThus, the Pentium must scale the argument by <em>ln(2)</em>, a constant that is in the ROM.\nThe error graph below shows the advantage of the Pentium's polynomial over the Taylor series polynomial.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/exp-error.png\"><img alt=\"The Pentium's 6-term exponential polynomial, compared with the Taylor series.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/exp-error-w400.png\" title=\"The Pentium's 6-term exponential polynomial, compared with the Taylor series.\" width=\"400\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">The Pentium's 6-term exponential polynomial, compared with the Taylor series.</div></p>\n<p>The polynomial handles the narrow argument range [-1/128, 1/128].\nObserve that when computing a power of 2 in binary, exponentiating the integer part of the argument is trivial, since it becomes the result's exponent.\nThus, the function only needs to handle the range [1, 2].\nFor range reduction, the constant ROM holds 64 values of the form <em>2<sup>n/128</sup>-1</em>.\nTo reduce the range from [1, 2] to [-1/128, 1/128], the closest <em>n/128</em> is subtracted from the argument and then the result is multiplied by the corresponding constant in the ROM.\nThe constants are spaced irregularly, presumably for accuracy; some are in steps of 4/128 and others are in steps of 2/128.</p>\n<h3>Logarithm</h3>\n<p>The Pentium can compute base-2 logarithms.<span id=\"fnref:log\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:log\">12</a></span>\nThe coefficients define polynomials for the hyperbolic arctan, which is closely related to log. See the comments for details. \nThe ROM also has 64 constants for range reduction: log<sub>2</sub>(1+n/64) for odd n from 1 to 63.\nThe unusual feature of these constants is that each constant is split into two pieces to increase the bits of accuracy:\nthe top part has 40 bits of accuracy and the bottom part has 67 bits of accuracy, providing a 107-bit constant\nin total.\nThe extra bits are required because logarithms are hard to compute accurately.</p>\n<h3>Other constants</h3>\n<p>The x87 floating-point instruction set provides direct access to a handful of constants&mdash;0, 1, pi, \nlog<sub>2</sub>(10), log<sub>2</sub>(e), log<sub>10</sub>(2), and log<sub>e</sub>(2)&mdash;so these constants\nare stored in the ROM.\n(These logs are useful for changing the base for logs and exponentials.)\nThe ROM holds other constants for internal use by the floating-point unit such as -1, 2, 7/8, 9/8, pi/2, pi/4, and 2log<sub>2</sub>(e).\nThe ROM also holds bitmasks for extracting part of a word, for instance accessing 4-bit BCD digits in a word.\nAlthough I can interpret most of the values, there are a few mysteries such as a mask with the inscrutable value\n<code>0x3e8287c</code>.\nThe ROM has 34 unused entries at the end; these entries hold words that include the descriptive hex value <code>0xbad</code> or perhaps <code>0xbadfc</code> for \"bad float constant\".</p>\n<h2>How I examined the ROM</h2>\n<p>To analyze the Pentium, I removed the metal and oxide layers with various chemicals (sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, Whink).\n(I later discovered that simply sanding the die works surprisingly well.)\nNext, I took many photos of the ROM with a <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2015/12/creating-high-resolution-integrated.html\">microscope</a>.\nThe feature size of this Pentium is 800 nm, just slightly larger than visible light (380-700 nm).\nThus, the die can be examined under an optical microscope, but it is getting close to the limits.\nTo determine the ROM contents, I tediously went through the ROM images, examining each of the 26144 bits and marking each transistor.\nAfter figuring out the ROM format,\nI wrote programs to combine simple functions in many different combinations to\ndetermine the mathematical expression such as <em>arctan(19/32)</em> or <em>log<sub>2</sub>(10)</em>.\nBecause the polynomial constants are optimized and my ROM data has bit errors, my program needed\nchecks for inexact matches, both numerically and bitwise.\nFinally, I had to determine how the constants would be used in algorithms.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>By examining the Pentium's floating-point ROM under a microscope, it is possible to extract the 304 constants\nstored in the ROM.\nI was able to determine the meaning of most of these constants and deduce some of the floating-point algorithms used \nby the Pentium.\nThese constants illustrate how polynomials can efficiently compute transcendental functions.\nAlthough Taylor series polynomials are well known, they are surprisingly inaccurate and should be avoided.\nMinor changes to the coefficients through the Remez algorithm, however, yield much better polynomials.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2020/05/extracting-rom-constants-from-8087-math.html\">previous article</a>, I examined the floating-point constants stored in the 8087 coprocessor.\nThe Pentium has 304 constants in the Pentium, compared to just 42 in the 8087, supporting more efficient algorithms.\nMoreover, the 8087 was an external floating-point unit, while the Pentium's floating-point unit is part of the\nprocessor.\nThe changes between the 8087 (1980, 65,000 transistors) and the Pentium (1993, 3.1 million transistors) are due\nto the exponential improvements in transistor count, as described by Moore's Law.</p>\n<p>I plan to write more about the Pentium so follow me on Bluesky (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/righto.com\">@righto.com</a>) or \n<a href=\"https://www.righto.com/feeds/posts/default\">RSS</a> for updates. (I'm no longer on Twitter.)\nI've also written about <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2024/12/this-die-photo-of-pentium-shows.html\">the Pentium division bug</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2024/08/pentium-navajo-fairchild-shiprock.html\">Pentium Navajo rug</a>.\nThanks to CuriousMarc for microscope help. Thanks to <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42606975\">lifthrasiir</a> and Alexia for identifying some constants.</p>\n<h2>Appendix: The constant ROM</h2>\n<p>The table below lists the 304 constants in the Pentium's floating-point ROM.\nThe first four columns show the values stored in the ROM: the exponent, the sign bit, the flag bit, and the\nsignificand.\nTo avoid negative exponents, exponents are stored with the constant <code>0x0ffff</code> added. For example, the value <code>0x0fffe</code>\nrepresents an exponent of -1, while <code>0x10000</code> represents an exponent of 1.\nThe constant's approximate decimal value is in the \"value\" column.</p>\n<p>Special-purpose values are colored. Specifically, \"normal\" numbers are in black.\nConstants with an exponent of all 0's are in blue,\nconstants with an exponent of all 1's are in red,\nconstants with an unusually large or small exponent are in green;\nthese appear to be bitmasks rather than numbers.\nUnused entries are in gray.\nInexact constants (due to Remez optimization) are represented with the approximation symbol \"≈\".</p>\n<p>This information is from my reverse engineering, so there will be a few errors.</p>\n\n<table class=\"rom\">\n

references</h2>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:lineage\">\n<p>In this blog post, I'm looking at the \"P5\" version of the original Pentium processor.\nIt can be hard to keep all the Pentiums straight since \"Pentium\" became a brand name with multiple microarchitectures, lines, and products.\nThe original Pentium (1993) was followed by the Pentium Pro (1995), Pentium II (1997), and so on.</p>\n<p>The original Pentium used the P5 microarchitecture, a superscalar microarchitecture that was advanced but still executed instruction in order like traditional microprocessors.\nThe original Pentium went through several substantial revisions.\nThe first Pentium product was the 80501 (codenamed P5), containing 3.1 million transistors.\nThe power consumption of these chips was disappointing, so Intel improved the chip, producing the 80502, codenamed P54C.\nThe P5 and P54C look almost the same on the die, but the \nP54C added circuitry for multiprocessing, boosting the transistor count to 3.3 million. \nThe biggest change to the original Pentium was the Pentium MMX, with part number 80503 and codename P55C. The Pentium MMX added 57\nvector processing instructions and had 4.5 million transistors.\nThe floating-point unit was rearranged in the MMX, but the constants are probably the same.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:lineage\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:flag\">\n<p>I don't know what the flag bit in the ROM indicates; I'm arbitrarily calling it a flag.\nMy wild guess is that it indicates ROM entries that should be excluded from the checksum when\ntesting the ROM.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:flag\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:significand\">\n<p>Internally, the significand has one integer bit and the remainder is the fraction, so the binary point (decimal point) is after the first bit.\nHowever, this is not the only way to represent the significand. The x87 80-bit floating-point format (double extended-precision) uses the same\napproach. However, the 32-bit (single-precision) and 64-bit (double-precision) formats drop the first bit and use an \"implied\" one bit.\nThis gives you one more bit of significand \"for free\" since in normal cases the first significand bit will be 1.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:significand\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:drivers\">\n<p>An unusual feature of the Pentium is that it uses bipolar NPN transistors along with CMOS circuits, a technology called BiCMOS.\nBy adding a few extra processing steps to the regular CMOS manufacturing process, bipolar transistors could be created. \nThe Pentium uses BiCMOS circuits extensively since they reduced signal delays by up to 35%.\nIntel also used BiCMOS for the Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and Xeon processors (but not the Pentium MMX). However, as chip voltages dropped, the benefit from bipolar transistors dropped too and BiCMOS was eventually abandoned.</p>\n<p>In the constant ROM, BiCMOS circuits improve the performance of the row selection circuitry.\nEach row select line is very long and is connected to hundreds of transistors, so the capacitive load is large.\nBecause of the fast and powerful NPN transistor, a BiCMOS driver provides lower delay for higher loads than a regular CMOS driver.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-fp-rom/binmos.png\"><img alt=\"A typical BiCMOS inverter.

The value <em>a</em> will be range-reduced, so <em>sin(a)</em> can be computed from the polynomial.\nThe terms <em>sin(b)</em> and <em>cos(b)</em> are available from the lookup table.\nThe desired value <em>sin(x)</em> can then be computed with multiplications and addition by using the trig\nidentity. Cosine can be computed similarly.\nNote that <em>cos(a+b) =cos(a)cos(b)-sin(a)sin(b)</em>; the terms on the right are the same as for <em>sin(a+b)</em>, just\ncombined differently. Thus, once the terms on the right have been computed, they can be combined to generate\nsine, cosine, or both.\nThe Pentium computes the tangent by dividing the sine by the cosine.\nThis can trigger the FDIV division bug;\nsee <a href=\"https://people.cs.vt.edu/~naren/Courses/CS3414/assignments/pentium.pdf\">Computational Aspects of the Pentium Affair</a>.</p>\n<p>Also see Agner Fog's <a href=\"https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf#page=164\">Instruction Timings</a>;\nthe timings for the various operations give clues as to how they are computed. For instance, <code>FPTAN</code> takes\nlonger than <code>FSINCOS</code> because the tangent is generated by dividing the sine by the cosine.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:sin\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 10 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:exponential\">\n<p>For exponentials, the <code>F2XM1</code> instruction computes <em>2<sup>x</sup>-1</em>;\nsubtracting 1 improves accuracy.\nSpecifically, <em>2<sup>x</sup></em> is close to 1 for the common case when <em>x</em> is close to 0, so subtracting 1\nas a separate operation causes you to lose most of the bits of accuracy due to cancellation.\nOn the other hand, if you want <em>2<sup>x</sup></em>, explicitly adding 1 doesn't harm accuracy.\nThis is an example of how the floating-point instructions are carefully designed to preserve accuracy.\nFor details,\nsee the book <code>The 8087 Primer</code> by the architects of the 8086 processor and the 8087 coprocessor.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:exponential\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 11 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:log\">\n<p>The Pentium has base-two logarithm instructions <code>FYL2X</code> and <code>FYL2XP1</code>.\nThe <code>FYL2X</code> instruction computes <em>y log<sub>2</sub>(x)</sub></em>\nand the <code>FYL2XP1</code> instruction computes <em>y log<sub>2</sub>(x+1)</sub></em>\nThe instructions include a multiplication because most logarithm operations will need to multiply to\nchange the base; performing the multiply with internal precision increases the accuracy.\nThe \"plus-one\" instruction improves accuracy for arguments close to 1, such as interest calculations.</p>\n<p>My hypothesis for range reduction is that the input argument is scaled to fall between 1 and 2.\n(Taking the log of the exponent part of the argument is trivial since the base-2 log of a base-2 power\nis simply the exponent.)\nThe argument can then be divided by the largest constant <em>1+n/64</em> less than the argument.\nThis will reduce the argument to the range [1, 1+1/32]. The log polynomial can be evaluated on the\nreduced argument. Finally, the ROM constant for <em>log<sub>2</sub>(1+n/64)</em> is added to counteract the\ndivision. The constant is split into two parts for greater accuracy.</p>\n<p>It took me a long time to figure out the log constants because they were split. The upper-part constants appeared\nto be pointlessly inaccurate since the bottom 27 bits are zeroed out.\nThe lower-part constants appeared to be miniscule semi-random numbers around ±10<sup>-13</sup>.\nEventually, I figured out that the trick was to combine the constants.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:log\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 12 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
