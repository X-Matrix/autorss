  "summary": "<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip — the same chip\nfound in the iPhone 17 lineup, iPhone Air, Apple Watch Ultra 3,\nand Apple Watch Series 11 — powers the new AirTag, making it\neasier to locate than ever before. Using haptic, visual, and audio\nfeedback, Precision Finding guides users to their lost items from\nup to 50 percent farther away than the previous generation. And an\nupgraded Bluetooth chip expands the range at which items can be\nlocated. For the first time, users can use Precision Finding on\nApple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, to\nfind their AirTag, bringing a powerful experience to the wrist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Solid update to the original AirTags, which <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-airtag/\">debuted five years ago</a>. Better range, louder speaker, increased precision. The form factor remains unchanged, so second-gen AirTags will fit in keychains or holders designed for the first-gen model. They even take the same batteries. Pricing also remains unchanged: $29 for one, $99 for a four-pack.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/26/airtags-gen-2\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Apple Introduces Second-Generation AirTags’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
