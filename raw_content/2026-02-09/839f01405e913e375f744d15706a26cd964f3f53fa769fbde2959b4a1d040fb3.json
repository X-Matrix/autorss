  "summary": "Welcome to part 3 of my series on OSNMA, the proposed Galileo Navigation Message Authentication protocol. This part can be read independently from part 1 and part 2, but it might be useful to read the introduction to part 1.\nThis post attempts to explain GPS (GNSS) jamming and spoofing, so it might be a useful read even if you don&rsquo;t care about Galileo or its authentication.\nAs usual, I&rsquo;ve been helped tremendously by Daniel Estévez &amp; many other researchers and Galileo professionals, and again I am very greatful for all the links, corrections, suggestions and knowledge you provided.",
