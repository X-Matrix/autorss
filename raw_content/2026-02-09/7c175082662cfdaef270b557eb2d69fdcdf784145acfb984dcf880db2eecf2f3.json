There are many good ways of working, and they are all context-dependent.</p>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t apply the same things that worked when you were a two-person startup operating out of the proverbial garage and expect them to work once your hypothetical unicorn has reached a thousand-plus developers. Even within the same organisation, processes that work for one team  can be catastrophic when applied to their neighbouring team.</p>",
