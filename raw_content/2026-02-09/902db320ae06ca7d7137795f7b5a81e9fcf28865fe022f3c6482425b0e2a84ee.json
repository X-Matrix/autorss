  "summary": "<p>I finally upgraded to a mechanical keyboard. But because Apple's so protective of their Touch ID hardware, there aren't any mechanical keyboards with that feature built in.</p>\n<figure class=\"insert-image\"><img alt=\"Apple Touch ID - external 3D printed sensor\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/why-doesnt-apple-make-standalone-touch-id/apple-touch-id-external-3d-printed-sensor.jpg\" width=\"700\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>But there <em>is</em> a way to hack it. It's incredibly wasteful, and takes a bit more patience than I think <em>most</em> people have, but you basically take an Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, rip out the Touch ID, and install it in a 3D printed box, along with the keyboard's logic board.</p>",
