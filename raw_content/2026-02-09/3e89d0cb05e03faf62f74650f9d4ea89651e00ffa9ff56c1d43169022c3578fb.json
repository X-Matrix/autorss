  "summary": "<p>In a high school math class, the solution to the equation bx = y is the logarithm of y in base b. The implicit context of the equation is the real numbers, and the solution is easy to calculate. The same problem in the context of finite groups is called the discrete logarithm problem, and it is difficult [&#8230;]</p>\nThe post <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/01/23/zkp-discrete-logarithm/\">How to prove you know a discrete logarithm</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog\">John D.
