  "summary": "This is a page about some of the mechanics of &lsquo;big data&rsquo;, specifically how to store, transfer and process perhaps 100s of millions or billions of rows/events.\nAlthough some people think big data starts at 65k rows, at which point Excel used to lose it, I&rsquo;m talking about gigabytes of data here.\nInfrastructure for this kind of thing abounds. Data can however come from lots of sources, and go to lots of different places.",
