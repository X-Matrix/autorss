  "summary": "The Collector I describe myself as a hobby collector. They mostly centre around making things, I have always been interested how things are made.\nHow it All Began The first book I ever read was an science book. I learned English watching &ldquo;Mythbusters&rdquo; and &ldquo;How it&rsquo;s made&rdquo; the Discovery channel. I have almost set fire to the house on many occasions as a young child. Growing up on a farm, certainly encouraged manual labour, taking things apart and fixing them.",
