  "summary": "<p>You already know that <a href=\"https://yarnspinner.dev\">Yarn Spinner</a> is one of the most powerful, flexible and innovative tools for writing interactive stories. Yarn Spinner makes it easy to write stories that run in any engine, on any platform. However, there’s one platform that we’ve neglected:</p>\n<p><strong>The printed page.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s why we’re thrilled to announce <a href=\"https://books.yarnspinner.dev\">Yarn Spinner for Books</a>. Yarn Spinner for Books allows writers to write their stories in the Yarn syntax that they know and love, and produce beautifully-typeset PDFs with their interactive stories.</p>",
