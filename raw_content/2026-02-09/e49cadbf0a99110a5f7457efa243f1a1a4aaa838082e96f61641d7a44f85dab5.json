Every month I join <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/hobart-sundays\">Lucie Cutting on Sunday mornings</a> to chat about what&rsquo;s happening above and beyond.</em></p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what we discussed, plus some of my notes, from <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/hobart-sundays/sundays/105487040\">this edition of the programme</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>The $88 Million Satellite That Just Stopped Talking</strong>\nMethaneSAT, backed by Jeff Bezos and designed to track methane emissions from oil and gas operations, has gone silent after just over a year in orbit. Before it died, the satellite managed to reveal that US oil and gas producers are emitting methane at over four times what they report to the EPA. We know exactly where it is - you can actually <a href=\"https://www.n2yo.com/?s=59101\">track its current position</a> - but it&rsquo;s stopped responding to commands entirely. There&rsquo;s some <a href=\"https://www.methanesat.org/project-updates/new-data-reveal-previously-undetectable-methane-emissions\">fascinating research on methane emissions monitoring</a> if you want to understand how this technology works.</p>",
