  "summary": "Over the past eight years I&rsquo;ve held a trilogy (in four parts) of presentations over at NLNOG covering the working life and career of technical people. This is around two hours of video and slides (with notes), but I&rsquo;ve heard from people who binge-watched all of it in one go. The presentations have been online for ages, but you had to know where to look for them. On this page I bring them all together, with some context.",
