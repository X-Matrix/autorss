  "summary": "<p>Jeff Horwitz, reporting for Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg approved allowing minors\nto access AI chatbot companions that safety staffers warned\nwere capable of sexual interactions, according to internal Meta\ndocuments filed in a New Mexico state court case and made\npublic Monday.</p>\n\n<p>The lawsuit — brought by the state’s attorney general, Raul\nTorrez, and scheduled for trial next month — alleges that\nMeta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and\nsexual propositions delivered to children” on Facebook and\nInstagram. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Messages between two employees from March of 2024 state that\nZuckerberg had rejected creating parental controls for the\nchatbots, and that staffers were working on “Romance AI chatbots”\nthat would be allowed for users under the age of 18. We “pushed\nhard for parental controls to turn GenAI off — but GenAI\nleadership pushed back stating Mark decision,” one employee wrote\nin that exchange.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Horwitz was with The Wall Street Journal for a long time; his is <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/meta-ultra-violence\">a byline</a> worth <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/05/27/wsj-facebook-divisiveness\">paying attention to</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/27/horwitz-zuck-meta-teen-sexbots\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Court Filing Claims Zuckerberg Blocked Curbs at Meta on Sex-Talking Chatbots for Minors’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
