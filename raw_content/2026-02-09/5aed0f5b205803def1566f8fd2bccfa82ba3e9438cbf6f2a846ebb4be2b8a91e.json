  "summary": "I prefer not to spend too much time talking about myself, but I also like to make it clear who I am and what I do, so people don&rsquo;t have to guess (because they might guess wrong).\nI studied physics at Delft University of Technology, but dropped out somewhere around 40%. I still love physics though.\nUntil relatively recently I was a part time ex-ante regulator of the Dutch intelligence and security services.",
