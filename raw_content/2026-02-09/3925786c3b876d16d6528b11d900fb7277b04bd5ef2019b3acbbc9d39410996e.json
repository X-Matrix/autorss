  "summary": "The very brief version: &ldquo;going to the cloud&rdquo; can mean renting services/servers that you could get from anywhere. There&rsquo;s little lock-in. The same four words &ldquo;going to the cloud&rdquo; might also mean locking your operations to a specific cloud provider, whose proprietary services will now be part of your business processes &ldquo;forever&rdquo;. Be specific which variant of cloud you are signing off on!\nI&rsquo;m mostly out of the office but this post was already in the pipeline and I thought it might be useful to get it out.",
