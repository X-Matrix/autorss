Well, not unless you buy the <a href=\"https://edatec.cn/docs/cm0nano/ds/\">CM0NANO development board from EDAtec</a>, or you live in China.</p>\n<p>This little guy doesn't have an HDMI port, Ethernet, or even USB. It's a special version of the 'Compute Module' line of boards. Little Raspberry Pi 'System on Modules' (SoMs), they're called.</p>",
