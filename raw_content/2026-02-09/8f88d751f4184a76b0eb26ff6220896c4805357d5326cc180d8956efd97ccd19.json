  "summary": "Hi everyone, Disclaimer: this is a review of a free sample I got sent by Uputronics.\nI recently spotted on Twitter that Uputronics had launched a GPS/RTS Raspberry Pi Expansion Board, and that they were looking for worthy projects to test it. I thought our Galileo/GPS/BeiDou/GLONASS monitoring project galmon.eu might be worthy and Uputronics agreed.\nRelevant for our purposes, this is an actual &rsquo;timing receiver&rsquo;. Any GNSS chip will get you a location, but some of them go the extra mile to also deliver a very stable clock signal.",
