  "summary": "<blockquote cite=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb3uK-_QkOo&amp;t=832s\"><p>This is the difference between Data and a large language model, at least the ones operating right now. Data created art because he wanted to grow. He wanted to become something. He wanted to understand. Art is the means by which we become what we want to be. [...]</p>\n<p>The book, the painting, the film script is not the only art. It's important, but in a way it's a receipt. It's a diploma. The book you write, the painting you create, the music you compose is important and artistic, but it's also a mark of proof that you have done the work to learn, because in the end of it all, you are the art. The most important change made by an artistic endeavor is the change it makes in you. The most important emotions are the ones you feel when writing that story and holding the completed work. I don't care if the AI can create something that is better than what we can create, because it cannot be changed by that creation.</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb3uK-_QkOo&amp;t=832s\">Brandon Sanderson</a>, via <a href=\"https://x.com/gvanrossum/status/2018491452771418402\">Guido van Rossum</a></p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/art\">art</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/guido-van-rossum\">guido-van-rossum</a></p>",
