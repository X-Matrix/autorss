  "summary": "Background Continuing my work with arm debugging on free microcontrollers recovered from disposable vapes, I felt like using a $5 raspberry pi pico to program and debug these micros was a bit too extravagant, too bourgeoisie. A working man&rsquo;s microcontroller deserves a blue collar debugger to match. I have been using the 10¢ ch32v003 RISC-V microcontroller for a few years now and I though it would be a perfect fit for this project.",
