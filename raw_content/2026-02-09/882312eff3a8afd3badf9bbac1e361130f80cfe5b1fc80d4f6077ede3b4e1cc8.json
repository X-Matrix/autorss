  "summary": "TLDR; You can find the project repository here.\nMotivation I recently took up pottery as my new favourite hobby and I needed a better way to control the firing of my pots.\nFor my first few pots, I just re-purposed my very cheap metal casting forge. I built this out of eight 1&quot; thick fire bricks, some fire cement, an electric stove top &ldquo;burner&rdquo; and a cheap PID controller.\nThe cheap PID controller was horrible.",
