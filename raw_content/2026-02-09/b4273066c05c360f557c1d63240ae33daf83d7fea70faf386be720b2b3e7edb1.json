I&rsquo;m publishing the book incrementally as I write, which means readers give me feedback about the book in real time.</p>\n<p>I started writing the chapters I felt most confident readers would like, but now that I&rsquo;m about 50% complete, I want to make sure the remaining chapters are things my readers actually want to learn.</p>",
