  "summary": "Preface This article is NOT served from a web server running on a disposable vape. If you want to see the real deal, click here. The content is otherwise identical.\nBackground For a couple of years now, I have been collecting disposable vapes from friends and family. Initially, I only salvaged the batteries for &ldquo;future&rdquo; projects (It&rsquo;s not hoarding, I promise), but recently, disposable vapes have gotten more advanced. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be the lawyer who one day will have to argue how a device with USB C and a rechargeable battery can be classified as &ldquo;disposable&rdquo;.",
