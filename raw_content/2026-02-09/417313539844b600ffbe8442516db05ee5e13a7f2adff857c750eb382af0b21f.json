  "summary": "<p>Wayne Ma and Qianer Liu, reporting for The Information (paywalled, alas):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple is developing an AI-powered wearable pin the size of an\nAirTag that is equipped with multiple cameras, a speaker,\nmicrophones and wireless charging, according to people with direct\nknowledge of the project. The device could be released as early as\n2027, they said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don’t make the mistake of thinking that because existing AI pins have sucked (and in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/nyt-humane\">one</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/18/hp-buys-humane\">notable</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/hp-humane\">case</a>, flopped in spectacular fashion), they’re all going to suck. Google Glass was an embarrassment but glasses are a great form factor. MP3 players used to suck too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Such a product would position Apple to compete more effectively\nwith OpenAI, which is planning its own AI-powered devices, and\nMeta Platforms, which is already selling smart glasses that offer\naccess to its AI assistant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is very strange to put OpenAI’s upcoming io device(s) in the same sentence as Meta’s glasses, which are a real product you can buy today. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/14/meta-claims-glasses-surging\">None of these things</a> are setting the world on fire though.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/22/information-apple-pin\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘The Information Says Apple Is Working on an AI Wearable Pin’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
