  "summary": "<p>Jeremy Fuster, reporting for TheWrap:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But save for some theaters in Republican-heavy states, the film is\nunlikely to leave much of an impact at a slumping box office, with\ntheatrical sources telling TheWrap that “Melania” is projected for\nan opening of around $3 million this weekend.</p>\n\n<p>That would put it below the last right-wing documentary, the Daily\nWire-produced Matt Walsh film “Am I Racist?,” which opened to $4.5\nmillion from 1,517 locations in September 2024, finishing with a\n$12.3 million total that made it the highest-grossing doc that\nyear. The highest projections are coming from NRG with an estimate\nof around $5 million, though audience interest polls from the\ncompany have 30% saying they are “definitely not” interested in\nwatching the film, an unusually high count for any wide release.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These projections are <em>with</em> a $35 million promotional campaign, for a movie Amazon paid $40 million to purchase.
