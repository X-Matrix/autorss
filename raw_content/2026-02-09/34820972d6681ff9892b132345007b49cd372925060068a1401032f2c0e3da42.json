  "summary": "Welcome back! In part 4 we went over the nitty-gritty of lambdas and how to store them, we explored the relation between the various C++ algorithms and containers, plus we took a stroll through some non-standard containers with exceptional capabilities.\nNote: part 1 is here.\nIn this probably final part 5, we&rsquo;ll be going over some of the most powerful stuff in modern C++: &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; reference counting and the concept of std::move.",
