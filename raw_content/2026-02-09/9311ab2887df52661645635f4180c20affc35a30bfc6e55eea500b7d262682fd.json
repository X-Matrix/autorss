If you had Internet access at home back then, it was almost certainly dialup modem (like I did); only the filthy rich <a href=\"/2022/05/so-long-home-t1-line-hello-hacking-t1.html\">had T1 lines</a> or ISDN. Moreover, from a user perspective, the hosts you connected to were their own universe. Things may have originated elsewhere, but everything on the host you connected to was a local copy: the mail you received, the files you could access, the posts you could read. Exceptional circumstances like NFS notwithstanding, what you could see and access was local &mdash; it didn't point somewhere else.\n<p>\nAround this time, however, was when sites started referencing other sites, much like the expulsion from Eden. In 1990 both HYTELNET and Archie appeared, which were early search engines for Telnet and FTP resources. Since they relied on accurate information about sites they didn't control, both of them had to regularly update their databases. Gopher, when it emerged in 1991, consciously tried to be a friendlier FTP by presenting files and resources hung from a hierarchy of menus, which could even point to menus on other hosts. That meant you didn't have to locally mirror a service to point people at it, but if the referenced menu was relocated or removed, the link to it was broken and the reference's one-way nature meant there was no automated way to trace back and fix it. And then there was that new World Wide Web thing introduced to the public in 1993: a powerful soup of media and hypertext with links that could point to nearly anything, but they were unidirectional as well, and the sheer number even in modest documents could quickly overwhelm users in a rapidly expanding environment. Not for nothing was the term \"linkrot\" first attested <a href=\"https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/22344/who-first-used-the-word-linkrot\">around 1996</a>, as well as how disoriented a user might get following even perfectly valid links down a seemingly infinite rabbithole.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidFL87TKIv_CE_b620Wf5uzFkkHvE6pfFDHCDYFu5vvatulznN9C73f9puDOOy0GhT3WxT8cTEM8XdbjPB9XC800198G6TfTkec_d3qTxYILV5Jvfxvzh8CwfcRNhDdhSVtOb8qA0NZDQChtZ-RriOTlX-xn3KmwHMQQd-a-UYN7a69AlizAuj6iNeshw/s2180/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%209.12.32%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidFL87TKIv_CE_b620Wf5uzFkkHvE6pfFDHCDYFu5vvatulznN9C73f9puDOOy0GhT3WxT8cTEM8XdbjPB9XC800198G6TfTkec_d3qTxYILV5Jvfxvzh8CwfcRNhDdhSVtOb8qA0NZDQChtZ-RriOTlX-xn3KmwHMQQd-a-UYN7a69AlizAuj6iNeshw/s320/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%209.12.32%E2%80%AFPM.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nOf course, other technically-minded folks had long been aware of the problem, and as early as 1989 an academic team in Austria was already trying to attack the problem of \"access to all kinds of information one can think of.\" In this world, documents and media resources could be associated together into a defined hierarchy, the relationships between them were discoverable and bidirectional, and systems were searchable by design. Links could be in anything, not just text. Clients could log into servers or be anonymous, logged-in users could post content, and in the background servers could talk to other servers to let them know what changes had occurred so they could synchronize references. Along the way, as new information resources via WAIS, Gopher and the Web started to appear, their content could also be brought into these servers to form a unified whole. This system was Hyper-G, and we'll demonstrate it &mdash; on period-correct classic RISC hardware, as we do &mdash; and provide the software so you can too.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzANrRw5swzmgFF-ap2zsEXaWyHGGpu5xOPkTU2rp9GPvAIpD_5OBKt69_VftBfG8nbwohKQayfAobjqMA_pFwVwLVFLIXmXa3thl4GbQTgtcCYmX93iUes46D4dt8aRBzO-YcaWNJ0NVi-lyhLA0D1Gwf9LYE_PwF3z8wBelyGKDPdhKojIOVYEVHk2E/s4080/PXL_20250516_224316936.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzANrRw5swzmgFF-ap2zsEXaWyHGGpu5xOPkTU2rp9GPvAIpD_5OBKt69_VftBfG8nbwohKQayfAobjqMA_pFwVwLVFLIXmXa3thl4GbQTgtcCYmX93iUes46D4dt8aRBzO-YcaWNJ0NVi-lyhLA0D1Gwf9LYE_PwF3z8wBelyGKDPdhKojIOVYEVHk2E/s320/PXL_20250516_224316936.jpg\" /></a></div>\n\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwO29ydxuTeMz6z63Y_BFUdeAjOuYRM7uhYjxYe_PI82So_WGzxDzsmm5vvTQ27Pst-U2zIelFB2yzzw9l2WF5tcCGVr8fYnGFDu6kGb9RykL_7WxpEI5sxw0161ZTZbXsrcYCxLJBE9qv2uCphd0MjeQNqDgPakUFsEMnC9YgLLA1vqoDuO1SNEhNhB4/s2500/memex-life-magazine-september-10-1945.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwO29ydxuTeMz6z63Y_BFUdeAjOuYRM7uhYjxYe_PI82So_WGzxDzsmm5vvTQ27Pst-U2zIelFB2yzzw9l2WF5tcCGVr8fYnGFDu6kGb9RykL_7WxpEI5sxw0161ZTZbXsrcYCxLJBE9qv2uCphd0MjeQNqDgPakUFsEMnC9YgLLA1vqoDuO1SNEhNhB4/s320/memex-life-magazine-september-10-1945.jpg\" /></a></div>\n\nHypertext &mdash; as well as hypermedia, even when the term hadn't yet been coined &mdash; was hardly a new concept, dating back to at least 1945 and Vannevar Bush's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex\">\"memex\" idea</a>, imagining not only literature but photographs, sketches and notes all interconnected with various \"trails.\" The concept was exceedingly speculative and never implemented (nor was Ted Nelson's Xanadu \"docuverse\" in 1965) but Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System \"NLS\" at the Stanford Research Institute was heavily inspired by it, leading to the development of the mouse and the 1968 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos\">Mother of All Demos</a>. The notion wasn't new on computers, either, such as 1967's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Editing_System\">Hypertext Editing System</a> on an IBM System/360 Model 50, and early microcomputer implementations like <a href=\"/2022/01/prior-art-dept-owl-guide-early.html\">OWL Guide</a> appeared in the mid-1980s on workstations and the Macintosh.\n<p>\nHermann Maurer, then a professor at the Graz University of Technology in Austria, had been interested in early computer-based information systems for some time, pioneering work on early graphic terminals instead of the pure text ones commonly in use. One of these was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUPID\">MUPID series</a>, a range of Z80-based systems first introduced in 1981 ostensibly for the West German videotex service <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildschirmtext\">Bildschirmtext</a> but also standalone home computers in their own right. This and other work happened at what was the Institutes for Information Processing Graz, or IIG, later the Institute for Information Processing and Computer-Supported New Media (IICM). Subsequently the IIG started researching new methods of computer-aided instruction by developing an early frame-based hypermedia system called COSTOC (originally \"COmputer Supported Teaching Of Computer-Science\" and later \"COmputer Supported Teaching? Of Course!\") in 1985, which by 1989 had been commercialized, was in use at about twenty institutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and contained hundreds of one-hour lessons.\n<p>\nCOSTOC's successful growth also started to make it unwieldy, and a planned upgrade in 1989 called HyperCOSTOC proposed various extensions to improve authoring, delivery, navigation and user annotation. Meanwhile, it was only natural that Maurer's interest would shift to the growing early Internet, at that time under the U.S. National Science Foundation and by late that year numbering over 150,000 hosts. Maurer's group decided to consolidate their experiences with COSTOC and HyperCOSTOC into what they termed \"the optimal large-scale hypermedia system,\" code-named Hyper-G (the G, <i>nat&uuml;rlich</i>, for Graz). It would be networked and searchable, preserve user orientation, and maintain correct and up-to-date linkages between the resources it managed. In January 1990, the Austrian Ministry of Science agreed to fund a prototype for which Maurer's grad student Frank Kappe formally wrote the architectural design as his PhD dissertation. Other new information technologies like Gopher and the Web were emerging at the same time, at the University of Minnesota and CERN respectively, and the Hyper-G team worked with the Gopher and W3 teams so that the Hyper-G server could also speak to those servers and clients.\n<p>\nThe prototype emerged in January 1992 as the University's new information system TUGinfo. Because Hyper-G servers could also speak Gopher and HTTP, TUGinfo was fully accessible by the clients of the day, but it could also be used with various Hyper-G line-mode clients. One of these was a bespoke tool named UniInfo which doesn't appear to have been distributed outside the University and is likely lost. The other is called the Hyper-G Terminal Viewer, or <tt>hgtv</tt> (not to be confused with the vapid cable channel), which became a standard part of the server for administration tasks. The success of TUGinfo convinced the European Space Agency to adopt Hyper-G for its Guide and Directory in the fall, after which came a beta native Windows client called Amadeus in 1993 and a beta Unix client called Harmony in 1994. Yours truly remembers accessing some of these servers through a web browser around this time, which is how this whole entry got started trying to figure out where Hyper-G ended up.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIeHZDMJwBsUwNJQONBFA7jM111LnDW76-OtcnDpu9ZJBCLv8c5PYtEFE8TBzl5XTawnzpPQcGwSchYM_Ll5zgAe448_A_vUsl5hfvHUaDxMr3oiaqpvdGfHzPygtD2Jdx6xRYGHBIHbvsOE1PlW5RAQI2At8Ku3N8W5J5zbHUQSxAtDmon6oh69OoLKM/s4080/PXL_20250516_171632796.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIeHZDMJwBsUwNJQONBFA7jM111LnDW76-OtcnDpu9ZJBCLv8c5PYtEFE8TBzl5XTawnzpPQcGwSchYM_Ll5zgAe448_A_vUsl5hfvHUaDxMr3oiaqpvdGfHzPygtD2Jdx6xRYGHBIHbvsOE1PlW5RAQI2At8Ku3N8W5J5zbHUQSxAtDmon6oh69OoLKM/s320/PXL_20250516_171632796.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nBeing (or at least starting as) an academic endeavour Hyper-G was well-documented, especially by the standards of the time: there are many primary-source papers on it from the IIG/IICM team and almost all of them were self-published or otherwise public. Similarly, the software, or at least the binaries of the software (something else we'll talk about), was also readily provided for download. The problem is that the articles and the software were generally distributed via FTP or Gopher and pretty much all of those repositories are no longer available. Although the Internet Archive has <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sunset_hyper-g_content\">a partial copy</a> of these files, it lacks, for example, any of the executables for the Harmony client. Fortunately there were also at least two books on Hyper-G, one <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/hypergnowhyperwa0000maur\">by Hermann Maurer himself</a>, and a second by <a href=\"http://www.dalitz.de/wolfgang/papers.html\">Wolfgang Dalitz and Gernot Heyer</a>, two partnering researchers then at the Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum f&uuml;r Informationstechnik Berlin (ZIB). Happily these two books have CDs with full software kits, and the later CD from Dalitz and Heyer's book is what we'll use here. I've already uploaded its contents to <a href=\"gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/archive/hyper-g-hyperg-ftp-iicm-tu-graz-ac-at\">the Floodgap Gopher server</a> to serve as a supreme case of historical irony.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgycD9ayfPpbY7WE_NohI_wIH58Rb01DYCpVIrOwY9TO4_GtfUICFHz7CQf8v2tpCksnjyVhLOjKeLOFhx2kpUDD-tTK64LhYj7lz_xfA3H81vc0oirWoTxTPtud6PqUf-Ye9VZ2-qYOZtNy4Tb5jw-w60sIJuFZVzggD0SFJGl6ilon3usrgi6VxJ93yk/s2192/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%206.05.18%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgycD9ayfPpbY7WE_NohI_wIH58Rb01DYCpVIrOwY9TO4_GtfUICFHz7CQf8v2tpCksnjyVhLOjKeLOFhx2kpUDD-tTK64LhYj7lz_xfA3H81vc0oirWoTxTPtud6PqUf-Ye9VZ2-qYOZtNy4Tb5jw-w60sIJuFZVzggD0SFJGl6ilon3usrgi6VxJ93yk/s320/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%206.05.18%E2%80%AFPM.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nAs its history would suggest, Hyper-G aimed to impose a strong hierarchy on the resources it managed, much more so than the Web and even stronger than Gopher's rigid menu-document paradigm. Rather than simply a sea of documents, items are instead organized into various <i>collections</i>. A resource must belong to at least one collection, but it may belong to multiple collections, and a collection can span more than one server. A special type of collection is the <i>cluster</i>, where semantically related materials are grouped together such as multiple translations, alternate document formats, or multimedia aggregates (e.g., text and various related images or video clips). We'll look at how this appears practically when we fire the system up.\n<p>\nAny resource may link to another resource. Like HTML, these links are called <i>anchors</i>, but unlike HTML, anchors are bidirectional and can occur in any media type like PostScript documents, images, or even audio/video. Because they can be followed backwards, clients can walk the chains to construct a link map, like so:\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgfcfyZv0K6tYEb8wve5nFCtkMOZJiSXiDFVb_J84_uzN06bXbutjDB2elQw7DCZBQdow7eh7DI9gsm0zTAoHa3eMStjAdbDMRuf9Xgzj8ukQmeji6xC-fAlXK-qGMo14WOYawyuZ9DpaXoo_oQJHkd0lJolJV5qR5Yoz4VzNO7wuW7Sd-tG19Nm26uE2s/s3204/Screenshot%202025-05-10%20at%203.58.00%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgfcfyZv0K6tYEb8wve5nFCtkMOZJiSXiDFVb_J84_uzN06bXbutjDB2elQw7DCZBQdow7eh7DI9gsm0zTAoHa3eMStjAdbDMRuf9Xgzj8ukQmeji6xC-fAlXK-qGMo14WOYawyuZ9DpaXoo_oQJHkd0lJolJV5qR5Yoz4VzNO7wuW7Sd-tG19Nm26uE2s/s320/Screenshot%202025-05-10%20at%203.58.00%E2%80%AFPM.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nThis example uses the <tt>man</tt> page for <tt>grep(1)</tt>, showing what it connects to, and what those pages connect to. Hyper-G clients could construct such maps on demand and all of the resources it shows can of course be jumped to directly. This was an obvious aid to navigation because you always could find out where you were in relation to anything else.\n<p>\nUnder the hood, anchors aren't part of the document, or even <a href=\"/2022/06/prior-art-dept-proletext-encoding-html.html\">hidden within it</a>; they're part of the metadata.

The title and its contents and even its location can change; the link will always be valid as long as the object exists, and if it's later deleted, the server can automatically find and remove all anchors to it. Analogous to an HTML text fragment, destination anchors can provide a target covering a specific position and/or portion within a text resource. As the process requires creating and maintaining various unique IDs, Hyper-G clients have authoring capability as well, allowing a user to authenticate and then insert or update resources and anchors as permitted. We're going to do exactly that.\n<p>\nSince resources don't have to be modified to create an anchor, even read-only resources such as those residing on a mounted CD-ROM could be linked and have anchors of their own. Instead of having their content embedded in the database, however, they can also appear as external entities pointed to by conventional filesystem paths. This would have been extremely useful for multimedia in particular considering the typical hard disk size of the early 1990s. Similarly, Internet resources on external servers could also be part of the collection:\n<p>\n<div class=\"tx\"><pre>\n  BEGIN Remote\n    ObjectID=0x00000019\n    Type=Document\n    DocumentType=Remote\n    Author=jfasch\n    TimeCreated=95/11/03 12:06:59\n    TimeModified=95/11/14 17:40:35\n    Title=en:CGI Documentation\n    Protocol=http\n    Host=hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu\n    Port=80\n    Path=/cgi/\n    MimeType=text\n    Sequence=250\n    Parent=hg-cgi\n    GOid=0x811b9908 0x00187b01\n  END Remote\n</pre></div>\n<p>\nWhile resources that are not Hyper-G will break the link chain, the connection can still be expressed, and at least the object itself can be tracked by the database. The protocol could be Hyper-G, Gopher, HTTP, WAIS, Telnet or FTP. It was also possible to create SQL queries this way, which would be performed live. Later versions of the server even had a CGI-compatible scripting ability.\n<p>\nI mentioned that the user can authenticate to the server, as well as being anonymous. When logged in, authenticated access allows not only authoring and editing but also commenting through annotations (and annotating the annotations). This feature is obviously useful for things like document review, but could also have served as a means for a blog with comments, well before the concept existed formally, or a message board or BBS. Authenticated access is also required for resources with limited permissions, or those that can only be viewed for a limited time or require payment (yes, all this was built-in).\n<p>\nIn the text file you can also see markup tags that resemble and in some cases are the same as, but in fact are not, HTML. These markup tags are part of HTF, or the Hyper-G Text Format, Hyper-G's native text document format. HTF is dynamically converted for Gopher or Web clients; there is a corresponding HTML tag for most HTF tags, eventually supporting much of HTML 3.0 except for tables and forms, and most HTML entities are the same in HTF. Anchor tags in an HTF document are handled specially: upon upload the server strips them off and turns them into database entries, which the server then maintains. In turn, anchor tags are automatically re-inserted according to their specified positions with current values when the HTF resource is fetched or translated.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjQES-1cQctUNBklzWAeEKTkziEH3DXGvEqGDm_qxEvGJPUM2U90iCqjYvb3VTMI0hyphenhyphendQWlbQUn9-jUBxc4V2l_ddBq_IzneVelyGuC_2x3SmNmtDdozEWzEydhIKxj_PH3DmfbZvwhgjdPb-UXFw84OEMia_wMlZzGjzUyHlV_0mXWyJxgwFA0Bub_t8/s2296/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%207.57.40%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjQES-1cQctUNBklzWAeEKTkziEH3DXGvEqGDm_qxEvGJPUM2U90iCqjYvb3VTMI0hyphenhyphendQWlbQUn9-jUBxc4V2l_ddBq_IzneVelyGuC_2x3SmNmtDdozEWzEydhIKxj_PH3DmfbZvwhgjdPb-UXFw84OEMia_wMlZzGjzUyHlV_0mXWyJxgwFA0Bub_t8/s320/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%207.57.40%E2%80%AFPM.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nThe Hyper-G \"server\" is actually several independent but interrelated components, all running as separate processes, and their specific functions have varied slightly over time. Internally, three servers implement the backend. The two straightforward ones are the database server (<tt>dbserver</tt>) that handles the database and the full-text index server (<tt>ftserver</tt>) used for document search. The document cache server (<tt>dcserver</tt>), however, has several functions: it serves and stores local documents on request, it runs CGI scripts (using the same Common Gateway Interface standard as a webserver of the era would have), and to request and cache resources from remote servers referenced on this one, indicated by the upper 32 bits of the global ID.\n<p>\nIn earlier versions of the server, clients were responsible for other protocols. A Hyper-G client, if presented with a Gopher or HTTP URL, would have to go fetch it.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitLJeJfk4SKVyJo4kGoXPx1owFbZj6ZrMgE9QAe6BvGoC6Qrh5PQebckwwRKHwYgPALkXc3v_chfIngPLoHdGjsRdEv2CdHCKUD0cRoFNqQkJ3HpwTyu1mxVpfc8gOHdd4hSvdBYDvSny6p3YEeyreiOqoicbO1q5ODDWjt8daBiWKojravzZOO7RrLwE/s2468/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%207.36.18%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitLJeJfk4SKVyJo4kGoXPx1owFbZj6ZrMgE9QAe6BvGoC6Qrh5PQebckwwRKHwYgPALkXc3v_chfIngPLoHdGjsRdEv2CdHCKUD0cRoFNqQkJ3HpwTyu1mxVpfc8gOHdd4hSvdBYDvSny6p3YEeyreiOqoicbO1q5ODDWjt8daBiWKojravzZOO7RrLwE/s320/Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%207.36.18%E2%80%AFPM.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nIn later releases, this capability was added to the document cache server as well, allowing it to act almost like a caching proxy. While every Hyper-G client dealt in HTF as its native format, and relatively simplistic translation could convert basic HTML into HTF, nothing said a later one couldn't understand HTML directly.\n<p>\nBecause Hyper-G is a stateful protocol, enveloping the backend is a process providing the session layer called <tt>hgserver</tt> (no relation to Mercurial). This talks directly to other Hyper-G servers (using TCP port 418), and also directly to clients with port 418 as a control connection and a dynamically assigned port number for document transfer (not unlike FTP). Since links are bidirectional, Hyper-G servers contact other Hyper-G servers to let them know a link has been made (or, possibly, removed), and then those servers will send them updates.\n<p>\nThere are hazards with this approach. One is that it introduces an inevitable race condition between the change occurring on the upstream and any downstream(s) knowing about it, so earlier implementations would wait until all the downstream(s) acknowledged the change before actually making it effective. Unfortunately this ran into a second problem: particularly for major Hyper-G sites like IIG/IICM itself, an upstream server could end up sending thousands of update notifications after making any change at all, and some downstreams might not respond in a timely fashion for any number of reasons. Later servers use a probablistic version of the \"flood\" algorithm from the Harvest resource discovery system (perhaps a <a href=\"/search/label/prior%20art\">future Prior Art entry</a>) where downstreams pass the update along to a smaller subset of hosts, who in turn do the same to another subset, until the message has propagated throughout the network (<i>p-flood</i>). Any temporary inconsistency is simply tolerated until the message makes the rounds. This process was facilitated because all downstreams knew about all other Hyper-G servers, and updates to this master list were sent in the same manner. A new server could get this list from IICM after installation to bootstrap itself, becoming part of a worldwide collection called the Hyper Root.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh94WRKxH_TUIcAPK0buGd_1jdqNRXQQZRLymhl16NDIX2FecwkNwSjcoc71Ku3NiUqLgRKgUlu0_vmmUuJCJJzi-VZz-LJ10PQFGaho9jWOEoFgAU3rMQ__OuAwqSSSz-t1VyHmPQ-103CuMb2V_xk7ui0EIt0P02IJwhi_mYk2QZWCmXM5WASzdC9k7I/s1674/Screenshot%202025-05-12%20at%205.30.01%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh94WRKxH_TUIcAPK0buGd_1jdqNRXQQZRLymhl16NDIX2FecwkNwSjcoc71Ku3NiUqLgRKgUlu0_vmmUuJCJJzi-VZz-LJ10PQFGaho9jWOEoFgAU3rMQ__OuAwqSSSz-t1VyHmPQ-103CuMb2V_xk7ui0EIt0P02IJwhi_mYk2QZWCmXM5WASzdC9k7I/s320/Screenshot%202025-05-12%20at%205.30.01%E2%80%AFPM.png\" /></a></div>\n\nFinally, a set of protocol conversion layers sit atop the session layer if the client is not speaking Hyper-G, such as a Gopher client or a web browser. These translate collections, HTF and links to resources into Gopher menus and HTML, as shown in the screenshot here of how the main IICM Hyper-G site looked in NCSA Mosaic in 1995. When translating from HTF or collection metadata, the Web gateway composes pages from templates and server-side includes and supports different templates for different languages; it can also serve pages of its own that are not part of the regular database. You can authenticate to the server through the Web gateway, but since HTTP is stateless and Hyper-G predated the wide use of cookies, the Web conversion layer generates a session key from the subprocess port number and a nonce for inclusion in the URL, noting the IP address using it. (It goes without saying this is incredibly insecure by modern standards.) An SNMP conversion layer also existed at one time, but was \"rarely used\" and not included in the default distribution.\n<p>\nThere are additional security considerations to running these early servers. Besides those obvious ones like authentication without encryption and the potential for spoofing session keys, the Hyper Root concept clearly hails from an earlier era where it wouldn't occur to a server to be an intentional bad actor. However, since messages aren't signed and are simply passed along, a malicious Hyper-G intermediary could wreck things in a hurry by substituting nonsense or deliberately false information about other hosts. Also, because only binaries have survived, we have no way of auditing the source for other lurking horrors or inadvertent holes. Since message passing and user logins are pretty essential parts of its basic functionality, although I'm unaware of any other classic Hyper-G or HyperWave servers still out there that could mess with us (we'll talk about its modern incarnation at the end), we'll be running it within our strict non-routable test network here at the Floodgap lab.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEis7hMBLq5mm4DyBoYnYbG_WAS-0Pl9L8DB4skIsxPp0TtX-IgaoDQcrHn9zfGmTJbyrKXzgUvHqVk60B0pxHxlI1eo7f-rcrcrLxZEqxY5nIDrbDezhmmq8LXL1WpTbnSJAneoE19fXAlqXWwmasCRAHIFrJfwgq7kB12VblIQdyV9w0JN2pXdmN79I3Y/s3152/1page.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEis7hMBLq5mm4DyBoYnYbG_WAS-0Pl9L8DB4skIsxPp0TtX-IgaoDQcrHn9zfGmTJbyrKXzgUvHqVk60B0pxHxlI1eo7f-rcrcrLxZEqxY5nIDrbDezhmmq8LXL1WpTbnSJAneoE19fXAlqXWwmasCRAHIFrJfwgq7kB12VblIQdyV9w0JN2pXdmN79I3Y/s320/1page.jpg\" /></a></div>\n\nEven with Gopher's then-significant install base and the rapid growth of the nascent Web, Hyper-G was successful enough that its team had increased to 65 members by August 1995. The University of Minnesota had made (in my opinion) a serious tactical error in 1993 by abruptly <a href=\"https://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/vms/networking/gopher/gopher-software-licensing-policy.ancient\">requiring license fees</a> for commercial use of their Gopher server implementation. Subsequent posts were made to clarify this only applied to UMN <tt>gopherd</tt>, and then only to commercial users, nor is it clear exactly how much that license fee was or whether anybody actually paid, but <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/comp.infosystems.gopher/c/T50smjLRGCM/m/lkBAfQ_AhHkJ\">the damage was done</a> and the Web &mdash; freely available from the beginning &mdash; continued unimpeded on its meteoric rise. (UMN eventually relicensed 2.3.1 under the GNU Public License in 2000.) Hyper-G's principals would have no doubt known of this precautionary tale. On the other hand, they also clearly believed that they possessed a fundamentally superior product to existing servers that people would be willing to pay good money for. Indeed, just like they did with COSTOC, the intention of spinning Hyper-G/HyperWave off as a commercial enterprise had been planned from the very beginning.\n<p>\nHyper-G, now renamed HyperWave, officially became a commercial product in June 1996. This shift was facilitated by the fact that no publicly available version had ever been open-source. Early server versions of Hyper-G had no limit on users, but once HyperWave was productized, its free unregistered tier imposed document restrictions and a single-digit login cap (anonymous users could of course still view HyperWave sites without logging in, but they couldn't post anything either). Non-commercial entities could apply for <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19961220133525/http://www.iicm.edu/hyperwave/registration;internal&amp;sk=ROBOT\">a free license key</a>, something that is obviously no longer possible, but commercial use required <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19961220140705/http://www.iicm.edu/hyperwave/server/prices.html;internal&amp;sk=ROBOT\">a full paid license</a> starting at US$3600 for a 30-user license (in 2025 dollars about $6900) or $30,000 for an unlimited one ($57,600). An early 1997 version of this commercial release appears to be what's available from the partial mirror at the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sunset_hyper-g_content\">Internet Archive</a>, which comes with a license key limiting you to four users and 500 documents &mdash; that expired on July 31, 1997. This license is signed with a 128-bit checksum that might be brute-forceable on a modern machine but you get to do that yourself.\n<p>\nFortunately, the CD from our HyperWave <em>book</em>, although also published in 1996, predates the commercial shift; it is a offline and complete copy of the Hyper-G FTP server as it existed on April 13, 1996 with all the clients and server software then available. We'll start with the Hyper-G server portion, which on disc offers official builds for SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.2 (SPARC only), HP-UX 9.01 (PA-RISC only), Ultrix 4.2 (MIPS DECstation \"PMAX\" only), IRIX 3.0 (SGI MIPS), Linux/x86 1.2, OSF/1 3.2 (on Alpha) and a beta build for IBM AIX 4.1.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYP2O9VlP6-5vdlLxzraxqQfxCQow28YN6est3khRZNRDtW6Sgrcwy1_nbE0a2KUrczkvb1EycsmHv3X-EMJMOZTm_RZ-Y6sfvu7FoRnWmWU4QOAZMe6tf7prVV4UACU9K0uyrcZHaKXNMDA4yERjoeEfIiR5zTCOwj4phSDJ_cMkTT_y_L-v6JgbEuRI/s4080/PXL_20250517_000858085.LONG_EXPOSURE-01.COVER.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYP2O9VlP6-5vdlLxzraxqQfxCQow28YN6est3khRZNRDtW6Sgrcwy1_nbE0a2KUrczkvb1EycsmHv3X-EMJMOZTm_RZ-Y6sfvu7FoRnWmWU4QOAZMe6tf7prVV4UACU9K0uyrcZHaKXNMDA4yERjoeEfIiR5zTCOwj4phSDJ_cMkTT_y_L-v6JgbEuRI/s320/PXL_20250517_000858085.LONG_EXPOSURE-01.COVER.jpg\" /></a></div>\n\nThe manual suggests modest but (for 1996) non-trivial system requirements, e.g., at least 48MB of RAM, a minimum of 50MB disk for the server software and then around 120MB or so of disk for every 10,000 objects (their estimate). I pricked up my ears when I saw AIX 4.1 listed, because running it on our trusty <a href=\"/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html\">Apple Network Server 500</a> would have been perfect: it has oodles of disk space (like, whole gigabytes, man), a full 200MHz PowerPC 604e upgrade, zippy 20MB/s SCSI-2 and a luxurious 512MB of parity RAM. I'll just stop here and say that it ended in failure because both the available AIX versions on disc completely lack the Gopher and Web gateways, without which the server will fail to start. I even tried the Internet Archive pay-per-u-ser beta version and it still lacked the Gopher gateway, without which it also failed to start, and the new Web gateway in that release seemed to have glitches of its own (though the expired license key may have been a factor). Although there are ways to hack around the startup problems, doing so only made it into a pure Hyper-G system with no other protocols which doesn't make a very good demo for our purposes, and I ended up spending the rest of the afternoon manually uninstalling it. In fairness it doesn't appear AIX was ever officially supported.\n<p>\nOtherwise, I don't have a <em>PA-RISC</em> HP-UX server up and running right now (just <a href=\"/2021/04/refurb-weekend-hewlett-packard-9000350.html\">a 68K one running HP-UX 8.0</a>), and while the SunOS 4 version should be binary compatible with my <a href=\"/2022/10/if-one-guis-not-enough-for-your-sparc.html\">Solbourne S3000 running OS/MP 4.1C</a>, I wasn't sure if the 56MB of RAM it has was enough if I really wanted to stress-test it.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirQEATlgLq-Hev3NfrbNTjx4joTxcbdaPBUG5a6QcZWi9Kd7NRjuEaAUY5N9ozLnsYKCkTxATKpHyZXp2JURrqavSn6XMT5wDWnLkHjgZA0Syp2DR1US1u0gyuJTymO7GL3HcNhSJSvefQ4u-1UvuvSszzysY0qpq2GFHL2M3vYR6Ff728CveyJ33dxmE/s4080/PXL_20250516_202349696.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirQEATlgLq-Hev3NfrbNTjx4joTxcbdaPBUG5a6QcZWi9Kd7NRjuEaAUY5N9ozLnsYKCkTxATKpHyZXp2JURrqavSn6XMT5wDWnLkHjgZA0Syp2DR1US1u0gyuJTymO7GL3HcNhSJSvefQ4u-1UvuvSszzysY0qpq2GFHL2M3vYR6Ff728CveyJ33dxmE/s320/PXL_20250516_202349696.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nSo I went with my Silicon Graphics Indy workstation as the server, which isn't completely ridiculous because SGI also sold the Indy headless as the Challenge S rackmount. This Indy has been upgraded to a 150MHz R4400SC, faster than the R4600 or baseline R4000, and second only to the higher R4400 tiers and the R5000. Even though its disk space is a little limited, something I need to rectify in the near future, it would be enough for our demonstration <em>and</em> it has 256MB of RAM. It runs IRIX 6.5.22 but that should still start these binaries.\n<p>\nThat settled the server part. For the client hardware, however, I wanted something particularly special. My original Power Macintosh 7300 (now with <a href=\"http://tenfourfox.blogspot.com/2017/11/and-now-for-something-completely.html\">a G4/800</a>) sitting on top will play a supporting role running Windows 98 in emulation for Amadeus, and also testing our Hyper-G's Gopher gateway with UMN TurboGopher, which is appropriate because when it ran NetBSD it was <tt>gopher.floodgap.com</tt>. Today, though, it runs Mac OS 9.1, and the planned native Mac OS client for Hyper-G was never finished nor released.\n<p>\nOur other choices for Harmony are the same as for the server, sans AIX 4.1, which doesn't seem to have been supported as a client at all. Unfortunately the S3000 is only 36MHz, so it wouldn't be particularly fast at the hypermedia features, and I was concerned about the Indy running as client and server at the same time. But while we don't have any PA-RISC <em>servers</em> running, we <em>do</em> have a couple choices in PA-RISC <em>workstations</em>, and one of them is a especially rare bird.

This unit has plenty of free disk space, 512MB of RAM and runs HP-UX 11.00, all of which should run Harmony splendidly, and its battery incredibly still holds some charge. Although the on-board HP Visualize-EG graphics don't have 3D acceleration, neither does the XL24 in our Indy, and its PA-7300LC will be better at software rendering than the Indy's R4400. Fortunately, the Visualize-EG has very good 2D performance for the time.\n<p>\nWith our hardware selected, it's time to set up the server side. We'll do this by the literal book, and the book in this case recommends creating a regular user <tt>hgsystem</tt> belonging to a new group <tt>hyperg</tt> under which the server processes should run. IRIX makes this very easy.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgFDAdhoqXpaRABZ-aU2ZmWfDd0kMoN8MxoI8MmXVi5ycsS-edq_4Z_b2RjzARu734KwRW8OWDt3pBumpjggkk1ncSF-TC5CZY7r6g8DSDc88CRwEbDJkhyubKGxdoQU5f1pSo9H6Yu0ao1i9kKdcSaEWtglkDWWaUsVPUjALzvbOMih5C5wPgzUx_Gqjw/s1280/1.rgb.png\" style=\"display: block;

This build of IE5 (5.00.2013.1312) is the cryptographically hopeless 40-bit export version circa 1999 and can run on HP-UX 10.20 or later.\n<p>\nIE for Unix was in development as early as 1996 in an attempt to crush Netscape on its home turf but got bogged down in a dispute (later a lawsuit) with Bristol Technologies, who originally planned to do the port with their Wind/U compatibility layer. Wind/U was Bristol's flavour of the ill-starred Windows Interface Source Environment initiative, using licensed Windows source code to allow Win32 applications to be recompiled on other operating systems. (Insignia SoftWindows was another WISE implementation, but in this case used for actual Windows emulation.) After contract negotiations failed Microsoft then went to Bristol's competitor Mainsoft in 1997, who themselves had a WISE-based porting layer called MainWin, and Mainsoft completed the port of MSHTML and the rest of IE4 for Solaris as a beta in November. The HP-UX version and the Solaris release version subsequently emerged in February 1998, and IE5 in February (Solaris) and March (HP-UX) 1999.\n<p>\nIE Unix was only ever released for Solaris and HP-UX, along with MainWin-based ports of Outlook Express and Windows Media Player purely for Solaris, though Microsoft originally intended it to be much more widely available. Ports to IRIX and AIX were mentioned, and MainWin could reportedly run <a href=\"https://public.dhe.ibm.com/aix/tools/mainsoft/MainWin33Build67ReleaseNotes.htm\">on those platforms</a> as well as Tru64, but no version for them ever emerged. After releasing 5.0 SP1 in 2001, Microsoft cited low uptake of the browser and ended all support for IE Unix the following year. As for Mainsoft, they became notorious for the 2004 Microsoft source code leak when a Linux core in the file dump fingered them as the source; Microsoft withdrew WISE completely, eliminating MainWin's viability as a commercial product, though Mainsoft remains in business today as <a href=\"https://harmon.ie/\">Harmon.ie</a> since 2010. IE Unix was a completely different codebase from what became Internet Explorer 5 on Mac OS X (and a completely different layout engine, Tasman) and of course is not at all related to modern Microsoft Edge either.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKcBvSfmHkXIJp9_bTYq9AuZ0dSxeO4X16gQOOyWKmiOTwoRyc_AarFR4v0jI9fMC7uxdiBCoXGIbQcfDPafsSdKwb6H6lJsWSZqA93TbSloIsTwUUJJXMi-oWs9Zp_r_0fJMNEex9lpcYKd1vZZcJW_bgo03gjIaBl1iUsBG1dUeBEh_v3OB1vIPj_sc/s1024/4.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKcBvSfmHkXIJp9_bTYq9AuZ0dSxeO4X16gQOOyWKmiOTwoRyc_AarFR4v0jI9fMC7uxdiBCoXGIbQcfDPafsSdKwb6H6lJsWSZqA93TbSloIsTwUUJJXMi-oWs9Zp_r_0fJMNEex9lpcYKd1vZZcJW_bgo03gjIaBl1iUsBG1dUeBEh_v3OB1vIPj_sc/s320/4.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nBy default IE5 also uses HTTP/1.1 (Navigator Gold 3.01 only uses HTTP/1.0) but this can be turned off.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWkyZrzy54g3iTyJt9xMGWxDo6kJ3UoZzIRGeWnh7mJj44hw0wbQwphKm0OkpN3w70WO0XRSGYNuKA_E4nGsmALXJpYMWxfR-wmu5iF8UfJuhf_qWxQ1Z7S64heQrjJBSmpzavn0L9oYJnqWkvsdXupNPBxaC-p4_nyMGPj5h5fmiWAfJpZBLJ8O8hYEs/s1024/5.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWkyZrzy54g3iTyJt9xMGWxDo6kJ3UoZzIRGeWnh7mJj44hw0wbQwphKm0OkpN3w70WO0XRSGYNuKA_E4nGsmALXJpYMWxfR-wmu5iF8UfJuhf_qWxQ1Z7S64heQrjJBSmpzavn0L9oYJnqWkvsdXupNPBxaC-p4_nyMGPj5h5fmiWAfJpZBLJ8O8hYEs/s320/5.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nOnce we do so, there's our gateway!

This just shows my previous anonymous sessions, as well as the fact that this version of the server software wasn't Y2K-ready, but if others were logged in they would also appear here.

Unfortunately, the generated Gopher menu is much more primitive and doesn't use i itemtype, making it look even more impoverished. Compared to the Floodgap gopher, our new Hyper-G gopher just has a search item to search the empty database and a spurious extra menu item from a spurious extra dot.\n<p>\nWe'll need to author something to do anything more meaningful at this point, so I suppose this is a good time to install the Harmony client. Let's do our hardware survey and check prerequisites.\n<p>\n<div class=\"tx\"><pre>\nruby:/pro/harmony/% uname -a\nHP-UX ruby B.11.00 A 9000/778 2000295180 two-user license\nruby:/pro/harmony/% model\n9000/778/B160L\nruby:/pro/harmony/% grep -i b160l /usr/sam/lib/mo/sched.models\nB160L   1.1e    PA7300\nruby:/pro/harmony/% su\nPassword: \n# echo itick_per_usec/D | adb -k /stand/vmunix /dev/mem\nitick_per_usec:\nitick_per_usec: 160\n# ^D\nruby:/pro/harmony/% cat /var/opt/ignite/local/hw.info \ndisk: 8/16/5.0.0 0 sdisk 188 31 0 ADTX_AXSITS2532R_014C 4003776 /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0 /dev/dsk/c0t0d0 -1 -1 5 1 9\ndisk: 8/16/5.1.0 1 sdisk 188 31 1000 ADTX_AXSITS2532R_014C 6342840 /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0 /dev/dsk/c0t1d0 -1 -1 4 1 9\ncdrom: 8/16/5.4.0 2 sdisk 188 31 4000 TOSHIBA_CD-ROM_XM-5701TA 0 /dev/rdsk/c0t4d0 /dev/dsk/c0t4d0 -1 -1 0 1 0\nlan: 8/16/6 0 lan0 lan2 0060B0C00809 Built-in_LAN 0\ngraphics: 8/24 0 graph3 /dev/crt0 INTERNAL_EG_DX1024 1024 768 16 755548327\next_bus: 8/16/0 1 CentIf n/a Built-in_Parallel_Interface\next_bus: 8/16/5 0 c720 n/a Built-in_SCSI\nps2: 8/16/7 0 ps2 /dev/ps2_0 Built-in_Keyboard/Mouse\nprocessor: 62 0 processor n/a Processor\n</pre></div>\n<p>\nOther than the CD-ROM, which was originally connected to the PrecisionBook's external SCSI port behind one of its side doors, everything else you've seen beforehand.\n<p>\nIn the Hyper-G world there are PDF-like documents, except that they're actually PostScript, not PDF. (PDF can be considered a descendant of PostScript, and the PDF specification was made public in 1993, but it was still proprietary in those days and not many people used it.) To view them we'll need Ghostscript installed, and we do have <a href=\"https://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/downloads.html\">an old version</a> ready to run.\n<p>\n<div class=\"tx\"><pre>\nruby:/pro/harmony/% /pro/local/bin/gs\nGNU Ghostscript 7.07 (2003-05-17)\nCopyright (C) 2003 artofcode LLC, Benicia, CA.

Other handlers start up as necessary.\n<p>\nOur next step is to create a non-privileged user. This will be largely for illustrative purposes since I'm going to be creating all the content under <tt>hgsystem</tt> anyway, but in a larger deployment you'd of course have multiple users with appropriate permissions. Hyper-G users are specific to the server; they do not have a Unix uid. Users may be in groups and may have multiple simultaneously valid passwords (this is to facilitate automatic login from known hosts, where the password can be unique to each host). Each user gets their own \"home collection\" that they may maintain, like a home directory. Each user also has a credit account which is automatically billed when pay resources are accessed, though the Hyper-G server is agnostic about how account value is added.\n<p>\nWe can certainly whip out <tt>hgadmin</tt> again and do it from the command line, but we can also create users from a graphical administration tool that comes as part of Harmony. This tool is <tt>haradmin</tt>, or the Harmony Administrator.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjW2Hu9riDUqCq4yD9a1_wn1awjFnYaQ0PS_VGwfrhiVvjciIZOvcqAhEmRn7esm5B_chiu0Npktcm1FaVQStP7f8MbTcXn7tVXYiiE9MsUNO7EYkMwdtSTkln3yThVBaV8-MCxgWPmSM-mMsmUUgCtPmLuZZk44SrZroXPfnDb8e71WqA7S666eiG1xAQ/s1024/haradmin1.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjW2Hu9riDUqCq4yD9a1_wn1awjFnYaQ0PS_VGwfrhiVvjciIZOvcqAhEmRn7esm5B_chiu0Npktcm1FaVQStP7f8MbTcXn7tVXYiiE9MsUNO7EYkMwdtSTkln3yThVBaV8-MCxgWPmSM-mMsmUUgCtPmLuZZk44SrZroXPfnDb8e71WqA7S666eiG1xAQ/s320/haradmin1.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nThe Administrator connects to the Hyper-G host on port 418 as usual.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGAKNJqVnm0vd80UcpqvXURnEzy7agYx0xj5ukJTv8gWFHrt0HBxRXLvFC7LQrc-Tm2VifIFz4CK53BYdU1zMKPOrDoK6Htv5QKdYErlFFuXJTYqN-2b6wZCkGc8pFLCNR7dqSpW-8MYpR3AqNBHAncJntHeTFCroIh2jTr7Dh10zldRDoQZpM2Rnm_NU/s1024/haradmin2.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGAKNJqVnm0vd80UcpqvXURnEzy7agYx0xj5ukJTv8gWFHrt0HBxRXLvFC7LQrc-Tm2VifIFz4CK53BYdU1zMKPOrDoK6Htv5QKdYErlFFuXJTYqN-2b6wZCkGc8pFLCNR7dqSpW-8MYpR3AqNBHAncJntHeTFCroIh2jTr7Dh10zldRDoQZpM2Rnm_NU/s320/haradmin2.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nNaturally we'll have to login to actually do anything, using the password we set previously.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4M2t7WLLcelPpDS-1cZFSuarbGIvUKnXPvz5iKLAYKdNP2cbblDcheurcq2vcfPT27Ic3v5D3EPSG-wPDSX7u8CJDoHOYUIJeBafHPNhBp6ScO38TQJaDWy-j8HNqUKvndhRdjyW93kSKW14WANEnurxyEg-RxlDSGgkhDVqesrkS9_juEKDxepkKQ6c/s1024/haradmin3.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4M2t7WLLcelPpDS-1cZFSuarbGIvUKnXPvz5iKLAYKdNP2cbblDcheurcq2vcfPT27Ic3v5D3EPSG-wPDSX7u8CJDoHOYUIJeBafHPNhBp6ScO38TQJaDWy-j8HNqUKvndhRdjyW93kSKW14WANEnurxyEg-RxlDSGgkhDVqesrkS9_juEKDxepkKQ6c/s320/haradmin3.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nThe one user on the system is us.

Although it's called a \"Document,\" this is only to distinguish it from anchors &mdash; the <tt>DocumentType</tt> is what we'd consider the \"actual\" object type. By default, all users, including anonymous ones, can view objects, but cannot write or delete (\"unlink\") anything; only the owner of the object and the system administrators can do those. In practical terms this unprivileged user with no group memberships we created has the same permissions as an anonymous drive-by right now. However, becase this user is authenticated, we can <em>add</em> permissions to it later. I've censored the most significant word in this and other screenshots with global IDs for this machine because it contains the Indy's IPv4 address and you naughty little people out there don't need to know the details of my test network.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidIyakMeuNhtSOMcfvJnfIGGwp-7u1y3tlhPHUBamrTHnEugGnQ1EY62Wa1Gfr8I3StGpU9CATsOe0UM-6loB31BSoA-Zs4y7i1OyOx1x1R_knEkbGFcS8Jb4-avNJIQzrXiozT9g_ma97ZXjPu5t3SEfRRR7gEmwkU4JE4ogd472dK_v_QX41JebpLrE/s1024/harmony4.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidIyakMeuNhtSOMcfvJnfIGGwp-7u1y3tlhPHUBamrTHnEugGnQ1EY62Wa1Gfr8I3StGpU9CATsOe0UM-6loB31BSoA-Zs4y7i1OyOx1x1R_knEkbGFcS8Jb4-avNJIQzrXiozT9g_ma97ZXjPu5t3SEfRRR7gEmwkU4JE4ogd472dK_v_QX41JebpLrE/s320/harmony4.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nSimilarly, here's the root collection properties.

I had to manually remove duplicate names from the file and manually adjust parents where one of those names was actually used somewhere else. I then copied it over to the Indy and imported it.

But that's what FTP servers are for! It's the '90s, man!

The Hyper-G box then gates views and assigns charges as applicable.

Recall from the introduction that a cluster is a special kind of collection intended for use where the contents are semantically equivalent or related, like alternative translations of text or alternative formats of an image. This is a rather specific case so for most instances, admittedly including this one, you'd want a collection. In practice, however, Hyper-G doesn't really impose this distinction rigidly and as you're about to see, a cluster mostly acts like a collection by a different term &mdash; except where it doesn't.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGeMcKLXL5LMj2VibecJ658UU10-y3QdYsUJDp5UdSmXdb251HhTR8U3tfmYqj-ATSCr9d8VkC0pmhX8dMU4F77WAipE5fiZc3bluWeyfY24RmGz-RmNPEHwQ4XuD1-Ljvzgl7z43N5sMH0I1OJaG9ckTcqihVFf5j4XaqBe4MW5sY4PKfTGmX0K61dTo/s1024/harmony38.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGeMcKLXL5LMj2VibecJ658UU10-y3QdYsUJDp5UdSmXdb251HhTR8U3tfmYqj-ATSCr9d8VkC0pmhX8dMU4F77WAipE5fiZc3bluWeyfY24RmGz-RmNPEHwQ4XuD1-Ljvzgl7z43N5sMH0I1OJaG9ckTcqihVFf5j4XaqBe4MW5sY4PKfTGmX0K61dTo/s320/harmony38.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nThis page is organized around a large panoramic view of the lab, so we start off by uploading that image. \n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBpqJuiu0_IhP5gmVZDZSy-lBWL_-raz4S96EuZQ97kQmviIMUqzj2_XN8sIbl0OC8-IwIGK9eLoRzl47MYn_30y-EhuNEXwAgwrjhye8zH6spoP27Gazxk9B-HhUdX9Sja3IpUKlvpd4BnE6tywOqDp68_kr6ZqOOzoAJNwDTIdYshNYNoO04SZoWDVI/s1024/harmony39.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBpqJuiu0_IhP5gmVZDZSy-lBWL_-raz4S96EuZQ97kQmviIMUqzj2_XN8sIbl0OC8-IwIGK9eLoRzl47MYn_30y-EhuNEXwAgwrjhye8zH6spoP27Gazxk9B-HhUdX9Sja3IpUKlvpd4BnE6tywOqDp68_kr6ZqOOzoAJNwDTIdYshNYNoO04SZoWDVI/s320/harmony39.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizXEEvHaX9thEoV_BFfkOkr9N7liXMO_qkTLFFF0K1jEfoLkiFfJEnNziU5Ji1Me2fgit5-Nd0-LrvtZl_DxfddlYbCfBVCh28fk0XRXoefA4O2LfUWBMkQ88Ch-E8e1tbKExh4pyxuCrbO0eOZEq_tm1IocTZwcvbV2vOIFCdeWaHr23shgKIWf6QbYo/s1024/harmony40.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizXEEvHaX9thEoV_BFfkOkr9N7liXMO_qkTLFFF0K1jEfoLkiFfJEnNziU5Ji1Me2fgit5-Nd0-LrvtZl_DxfddlYbCfBVCh28fk0XRXoefA4O2LfUWBMkQ88Ch-E8e1tbKExh4pyxuCrbO0eOZEq_tm1IocTZwcvbV2vOIFCdeWaHr23shgKIWf6QbYo/s320/harmony40.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nHarmony has its own image viewer; it does not depend on any existing image conversion or viewing utilities.

Anchors can be created in any document type. In PostScript, they're just text ranges too; in movie files, they would be polygons covering a particular range of frames; in audio files, they would be a sample range.\n<p>\nYou probably didn't see any difference between treating the machine room as a cluster and a collection, but in actual use the client will assume that, being a cluster, you don't want multiple images from the cluster open simultaneously because theoretically they are the \"same\" image (for various values of \"same\"). This made creating links more difficult than these screenshots would indicate, facilitated by the fact the link creator will remember recent anchors even if those documents aren't open anymore. However, if you have text in the cluster also, then the text viewer and the image viewer <em>can</em> be open at the same time &mdash; I guess for people who might do text descriptions for the visually impaired, or something. Clusters appear differently in two other respects we'll get to a little later on.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrFKLYxe3Hrlfc6DiohHNZWgOSN9-zoB41_fHe5fe5NisibaJSEcrOcuItAsOGvY5Rxk6w_l9azRir6RBaVS7j-AR6aiyNxGxyuFbwnL2wAjNHV5x4Z9Jptiq1xDskp5NlO_WI7W_pRetEpEZNjjW39yVsYCK1ZwzeRQyJcRtGsb4cCHSueyA7_HeVz_M/s1024/hvrml00.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrFKLYxe3Hrlfc6DiohHNZWgOSN9-zoB41_fHe5fe5NisibaJSEcrOcuItAsOGvY5Rxk6w_l9azRir6RBaVS7j-AR6aiyNxGxyuFbwnL2wAjNHV5x4Z9Jptiq1xDskp5NlO_WI7W_pRetEpEZNjjW39yVsYCK1ZwzeRQyJcRtGsb4cCHSueyA7_HeVz_M/s320/hvrml00.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nHyper-G really wanted to lean into visualization in a big way, and VRML, the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (formerly <em>Markup</em> Language), was nearly a first-class citizen. Most modern browsers don't support VRML and its technological niche is now mostly occupied by <a href=\"https://webx3d.org/\">X3D</a>, which is largely backwards-compatible with it. Like older browsers, Hyper-G needs an external viewer (in this case VRweb, which we loaded onto the system as part of the Harmony client install), but once installed VRML becomes just as smoothly integrated into the client as PostScript documents. Let's create a new collection with the sample VRML documents that came with VRweb.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYBh6Jfm10HkDSCzt46114OxREMNELedVTIUU8HPcmsMAUZ2g0E0OmTVDmuXbMhOkma4Ypsqxn0m9UV1xpltHpRKoEmBP2RS4VsAJu2a1A2molqih4QR7D7P5Qemhh3i_jwFd-vd3U9sX0wzQBtXcBrSCntprt4NXDjTgCx-7wU87bAyxi4Zt68ySFnhA/s1024/hvrml01.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYBh6Jfm10HkDSCzt46114OxREMNELedVTIUU8HPcmsMAUZ2g0E0OmTVDmuXbMhOkma4Ypsqxn0m9UV1xpltHpRKoEmBP2RS4VsAJu2a1A2molqih4QR7D7P5Qemhh3i_jwFd-vd3U9sX0wzQBtXcBrSCntprt4NXDjTgCx-7wU87bAyxi4Zt68ySFnhA/s320/hvrml01.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nThe process of uploading them is much the same, but notice there is a new document type we're using called Scene.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmPfiqwUokFsKDtqKCLYxXdL9TboKDUs7j58RlsPlPaGNxy0xZS4Q5FYD2ECAzf8muZD60YHTyFr5ZM9eGfHTJ3nT4_0mWBHaOkufHyWFmo949q5AWjvZgvxYBIC5bdaoqqOQ_vm4HWzshS3td0aB3xbC7f4YcPcNrJwUKhl7zNJFuAlc32MwtjBrHqgg/s1024/hvrml02.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmPfiqwUokFsKDtqKCLYxXdL9TboKDUs7j58RlsPlPaGNxy0xZS4Q5FYD2ECAzf8muZD60YHTyFr5ZM9eGfHTJ3nT4_0mWBHaOkufHyWFmo949q5AWjvZgvxYBIC5bdaoqqOQ_vm4HWzshS3td0aB3xbC7f4YcPcNrJwUKhl7zNJFuAlc32MwtjBrHqgg/s320/hvrml02.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nSuch documents get their own special icon and appear as scenes in the attributes view.

For this purpose, doing so is arguably even desirable. The links still go to the individual resources rather than jumping from fragment to fragment, though.\n<p>\nThe other major client was Amadeus, which is Windows-specific. A later version of Amadeus is in the Internet Archive mirror but we'll stick with the beta version 1.00.001 on the CD just in case the later one tries to do operations this server doesn't like. Although I'm not going to demonstrate authoring in Amadeus, it is fully capable of doing so, and uniquely offers RTF-to-HTF translation so you can use most Windows word processors to write documents instead of dinking around in a text editor by hand. It can run on Windows 3.1 with Win32s, or Windows 95 and later. Here we'll run it under Windows 98 in Virtual PC 3.0 on the Power Macintosh 7300.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinpnRuKCNfs2_wxSTiI4IsDeEoZT3zUYyJ_0hKRhqHq8pbBjPfyy2-jLjG1zfaU8WYq3xzKBLgESDREe4clWEl1dqkrk5HFpscz3Hv_UTVYFK0GUN_qPEcyDIP0bTJ_5taB3aGiFSjzGY8TYoAF-Y4SgwSXO5KDM146YokHEyky_Bl1sL6mlT4MC3tYm0/s640/picture_1.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinpnRuKCNfs2_wxSTiI4IsDeEoZT3zUYyJ_0hKRhqHq8pbBjPfyy2-jLjG1zfaU8WYq3xzKBLgESDREe4clWEl1dqkrk5HFpscz3Hv_UTVYFK0GUN_qPEcyDIP0bTJ_5taB3aGiFSjzGY8TYoAF-Y4SgwSXO5KDM146YokHEyky_Bl1sL6mlT4MC3tYm0/s320/picture_1.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nStarting the setup program.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj281I4Zd8Y-CQ1CF2vDg0uE_NUDEnXIIabaSEV0vn7vA2ZE3xZJCyC7_k_KAr_rXQxFSwGUKjf9vf7lOXcC-XP0tcqEi0M4x9Cs2HHazO9sRruS8rCi8v18BM-hpryNATKOTsZcq_JCP4aZXd9eOOPn0R52Ou84AY6KH1fSpEd9JCgs1WE6Ww8rR_5ni0/s640/picture_2.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj281I4Zd8Y-CQ1CF2vDg0uE_NUDEnXIIabaSEV0vn7vA2ZE3xZJCyC7_k_KAr_rXQxFSwGUKjf9vf7lOXcC-XP0tcqEi0M4x9Cs2HHazO9sRruS8rCi8v18BM-hpryNATKOTsZcq_JCP4aZXd9eOOPn0R52Ou84AY6KH1fSpEd9JCgs1WE6Ww8rR_5ni0/s320/picture_2.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nI don't really miss installers thinking they can dump everything in <tt>C:\\</tt> ...\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcAP6hf2CWgaQbRykTpwJ0C5fOukvhPQ0YcIoKdOyVar_azw3yzCrNlHqD0mSX78sQgODAlq4ILcHHPBImubRzocoTkzFg9O5f6ybXl71ILsPVjZT3nKABrkPlw94eSMN7qDguBvlm_SoaN8n9i85U5zX2rcWXe_7BoXqU0MvUSICW24hIhfxLzBCur40/s640/picture_3.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcAP6hf2CWgaQbRykTpwJ0C5fOukvhPQ0YcIoKdOyVar_azw3yzCrNlHqD0mSX78sQgODAlq4ILcHHPBImubRzocoTkzFg9O5f6ybXl71ILsPVjZT3nKABrkPlw94eSMN7qDguBvlm_SoaN8n9i85U5zX2rcWXe_7BoXqU0MvUSICW24hIhfxLzBCur40/s320/picture_3.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\n... or having to abbreviate <tt>\\Program Files</tt> as <tt>\\PROGRA~1</tt>.\n<p>\nThis version of Amadeus is distributed in multiple floppy-sized archives.

There is also a Windows-based \"Easy\" standalone viewer suitable for public kiosks, basically a stripped-down Amadeus (the same or similar codebase) with a different interface, server-customizeable styling, and no authoring support. The ZIP files for earlier versions of Easy could fit on a single 1.44MB floppy. I won't be demonstrating it here, but you can download and play with it if you like.\n<p>\nThese clients could also be set up with an offline database and run independently, even completely off the network. This feature didn't get much public traction but apparently was used in a few educational settings like museums.\n<p>\nAs our last stop, I want to go back to annotations and permissions, which I think have a uniquely strong claim on prior art because they anticipate the more participatory features of \"Web 2.0\" (however you would define it) but years earlier.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1F_YQotGdhNiT97GzIGP8RRKx-IzCw6Zd6WtcpwOP58rfh4P0s8mLThTbLCeX0z0tvRxUgKOLDnRPbYCasxLZXf-GmBkni66T5v0l8CPzazY81guTKKVdXcy7_PGgU89EekCflvZneI3vdTwsUFJgy2l8sqybHZbk4MKjzLzz6hIam7aSmAtd_Er-tpE/s1024/anno00.xwd.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1F_YQotGdhNiT97GzIGP8RRKx-IzCw6Zd6WtcpwOP58rfh4P0s8mLThTbLCeX0z0tvRxUgKOLDnRPbYCasxLZXf-GmBkni66T5v0l8CPzazY81guTKKVdXcy7_PGgU89EekCflvZneI3vdTwsUFJgy2l8sqybHZbk4MKjzLzz6hIam7aSmAtd_Er-tpE/s320/anno00.xwd.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>\n\nLet's consider this setup where we have two unprivileged users and the system administrator.

That would have been a pain in Harmony but a clueful Hyper-G client might do just that as a convenience, and could also implement the tree view graphically. On the server side Hyper-G was already ready to support interactive content like this and, at least early on, the Hyper-G team even encouraged that sort of creative client software.

Gopher no longer had any large-scale relevance and the Web had clearly become dominant, causing Hyperwave to also gradually de-emphasize its own native client in lieu of uploading and managing content with more typical tools like WebDAV, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20010409200031/http://www.hyperwave.com/e/products/his.html\">Windows Explorer and Microsoft Word</a>, and administering and accessing it with a regular web browser (offline operation was still supported), as depicted in this screenshot from the same year. Along the way the capital W got dropped, becoming merely Hyperwave. In all of these later incarnations, however, the bidirectional linkages and strict hierarchy remained intact as foundational features in some form, even though the massive Hyper Root concept contemplated by earlier versions ultimately fell by the wayside.\n<p>\nHyperwave continues to be sold as <a href=\"https://www.hyperwave.com/media/hyperwave_datenblatt_en.pdf\">a commercial product</a> today, with the company revived <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060326052619/http://www.hyperwave.com/e/news/pr117.html\">after a 2005 reorganization</a>,<!-- https://my.realstorygroup.com/Blog/hyperwave-survives-2006 --> and the underlying technology of Hyper-G still seems to be a part of <a href=\"https://www.hyperwave.com/media/hyperwave_datenblatt_en.pdf\">the most current release</a>. As proof, at the IICM &mdash; now after several name changes called the <a href=\"https://www.tugraz.at/institute/hcc/home\">Institute of Human-Centred Computing</a>, with professor Frank Kappe <a href=\"https://www.tugraz.at/institute/hcc/institute/people\">its first deputy</a> &mdash; there's still <a href=\"https://www2.iicm.tugraz.at/\">a HyperWave [sic] IS/7 server</a>. It has a home collection just like ours with exactly one item, <a href=\"https://www2.iicm.tugraz.at/maurer\">Herman Maurer's home page</a>, who as of this writing still remains on Hyperwave's advisory board.\n<p>\nAlthough later products have attempted to do similar sorts of large-scale document and resource management, Hyper-G pioneered the field by years, and even smaller such tools owe it a debt either directly or by independent convergent evolution. That makes it more than appropriate to appear in the Prior Art Department, especially since some of its more innovative solutions to hypermedia's intrinsic navigational issues have largely been forgotten &mdash; or badly reinvented. That said, unlike many such examples of prior art, it has managed to quietly evolve and survive to the present, even if by doing so it lost much of its unique nature and some of its wildest ideas. Of course, without those wild ideas, this article would have been a great deal less interesting.\n<p>\nYou can access the partial mirror on the <a href=\"https://archive.org/download/sunset_hyper-g_content\">Internet Archive</a>, or our copy of the CD with everything I've demonstrated here and more on <a href=\"gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/archive/hyper-g-hyperg-ftp-iicm-tu-graz-ac-at\">the Floodgap gopher server</a>.",
