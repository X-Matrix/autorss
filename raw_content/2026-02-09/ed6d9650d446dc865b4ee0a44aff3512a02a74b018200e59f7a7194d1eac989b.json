  "summary": "I&rsquo;ve been using gnuplot since.. like forever. It is one of my best friends in plotting data and discovering what is going on. But for all its greatness, you do tend to run into a wall - once you step outside the things gnuplot is good at, suddenly large heaps of awk, sort, unique and odd shell scripts are required to get to the next level. This is no criticism of gnuplot - it is great for what it is for.",
