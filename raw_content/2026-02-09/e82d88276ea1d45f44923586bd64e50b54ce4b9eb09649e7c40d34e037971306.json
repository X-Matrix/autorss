This post is just explaining why I believe it can be a useful exercise, not any truly original thinking!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the things that is really important to me is that my team and I keep learning at work. As such, fostering a learning environment is kinda key. I think we do that pretty well at Haplo &ndash; we have hired nearly exclusively early-career developers to our tech team for several years now, and one of the key points most hires mention as to why they join is that they feel it&rsquo;s a good place to learn quickly, with the requisite support early on in their career.</p>",
