  "summary": "A very practical introduction to Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs), in which we&rsquo;ll build a non-trivial parser using the most excellent cpp-peglib single-include C++ library. Post includes links to PEG libraries for Go, Rust and Python, and a ready to run GitHub repository of all examples.\nIf I&rsquo;ll ever stop programming it will be because I can no longer find the energy to parse even just one more string format.",
