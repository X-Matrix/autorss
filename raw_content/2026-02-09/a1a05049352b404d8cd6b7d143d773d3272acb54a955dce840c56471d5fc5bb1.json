You are very welcome to improve this page via GitHub!\nIn the previous chapter we taught a network of linear combinations and &lsquo;rectified linear units&rsquo; to recognize handwritten digits reasonably successfully. But we already noted that the network would be sensitive to the exact location of pixels, and that it does not in any meaningful way &ldquo;know&rdquo; what a 7 looks like.",
