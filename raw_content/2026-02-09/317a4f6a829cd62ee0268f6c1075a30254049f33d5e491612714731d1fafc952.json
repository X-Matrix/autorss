  "summary": "A from scratch GPU-free introduction to modern machine learning. Many tutorials exist already of course, but this one aims to really explain what is going on, from the ground up. Also, we&rsquo;ll develop the demo until it is actually useful on real life data which you can supply yourself.\nOther documents start out from the (very impressive) PyTorch environment, or they attempt to math it up from first principles. Trying to understand deep learning via PyTorch is like trying to learn aerodynamics from flying an Airbus A380.",
