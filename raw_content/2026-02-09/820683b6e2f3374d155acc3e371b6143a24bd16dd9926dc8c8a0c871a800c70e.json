That&#8217;s true, but a more accurate result says π(x) is asymptotically equal to li(x) where Five years ago I wrote about a result that was new at the [&#8230;]</p>\nThe post <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/01/16/prime-number-theorem-bounds/\">Tighter bounds in the prime number theorem</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog\">John D.
