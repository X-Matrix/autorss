  "summary": "<p>In <a href=\"https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2026-01-18T2051\">his talk</a>, I like the way Jake Nations pits easy vs. simple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Easy means you can add it to your system quickly. Simple means you can understand the work that you’ve done. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I like this framing.</p>\n<p>Easy means you can do with little effort.</p>\n<p>Simple means you can understand what you do with little effort.</p>\n<p>In other words: easy measures the effort in doing, while simple measures the effort in understanding the doing.</p>\n<p>For example: <code>npm create framework@latest</code> or “Hey AI, build an instagram clone”. These both get you a website with little effort (easy) but do you understand what you just did (simple)?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2016-11-18T1230\">It’s easy to get complexity</a>, but it’s not easy to get simplicity.</p>\n<p>(I get this is arguing semantics and definitions, but I find it to be a useful framing personally. Thanks Jake!)</p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/easy-vs-simple/\">Email</a>\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>",
