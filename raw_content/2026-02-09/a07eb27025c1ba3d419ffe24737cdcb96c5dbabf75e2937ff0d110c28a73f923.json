  "summary": "<p>Jeff Johnson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Finder has four view modes, represented by the four consecutive\ntoolbar icons in the screenshot below, if you can even call that\nfree-floating monstrosity a toolbar anymore: Icons, List, Columns,\nand Gallery. My preference is columns view, which I’ve been using\nfor as long as I remember, going back to Mac OS X.</p>\n\n<p>At the bottom of each column is a resizing widget that you can use\nto change the width of the columns. Or rather, you <em>could</em> use it to\nchange the width of the columns. On macOS Tahoe, the horizontal\nscroller covers the resizing widget and prevents it from being\nclicked!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/12/macos-26-cut-corner\">joked last week</a> that it would make more sense if we found out that the team behind redesigning the UI for MacOS 26 Tahoe was hired by Meta not <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/12/bad_dye_job\">a month ago</a>, but an entire year ago, and secretly sabotaged their work to make the Mac look clownish and amateur. More and more I’m wondering if the joke’s on us and it actually happened that way. It’s like MacOS, once the crown jewel of computer human interface design, has been vandalized.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/22/macos-26-tahoe-broke-column-view-in-the-finder\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘MacOS 26 Tahoe Broke Column View in the Finder’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
