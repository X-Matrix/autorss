  "summary": "Welcome to Kolmo There are three avenues to learn about Kolmo (GitHub). There are two Youtube videos, one from the most excellent NLNOG 2017, the other from the equally excellent UKNOF 38. These videos explain a lot of the the history and the &lsquo;why&rsquo; behind Kolmo.\nThere is also the kolmo.org website, which is &lsquo;self-hosted&rsquo; by the ws Kolmo-powered webserver.\nFinally, there is this post, in which I focus on what Kolmo actually does, without spending much time on the &lsquo;why&rsquo; or the history.",
