  "summary": "<p>The previous post contained an interesting observation: Is it true more generally that for large n? Sorta, but the approximation gets better if we add a correction factor. If we square both sides of the approximation and move the factorials to one side, the question becomes whether Now the task becomes to estimate the middle coefficient [&#8230;]</p>\nThe post <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/01/12/the-middle-binomial-coefficient/\">The middle binomial coefficient</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog\">John D.
