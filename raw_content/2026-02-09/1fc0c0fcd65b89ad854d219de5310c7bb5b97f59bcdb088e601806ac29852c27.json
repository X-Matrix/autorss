  "summary": "This page is part of the Hello Deep Learning series of blog posts. You are very welcome to improve this page via GitHub!\nIn the previous chapter we configured a neural network and made it learn to distinguish between the digits 3 and 7. The learning turned out to consist of &ldquo;twisting the knobs in the right direction&rdquo;. Although simplistic, the results were pretty impressive. But, you might still be a bit underwhelmed - the network only distinguished between two digits.",
