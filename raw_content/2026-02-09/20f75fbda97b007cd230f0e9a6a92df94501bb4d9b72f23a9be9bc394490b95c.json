  "summary": "This article is part of a series on (European) innovation and capabilities.\nIn a break from the usual GPS/Galileo, DNA and C++ posts, here is a bit on 5G and national security. It turns out that through PowerDNS and its parent company Open-Xchange, we know a lot about how large scale European communication service providers work - most of whom are our customers in some way.\nIn addition, in a previous life I worked in national security and because of that I have relevant knowledge of how governments (your own and foreign ones) &ldquo;interact&rdquo; with telecommunication providers.",
