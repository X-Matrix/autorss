Can you believe that I wrote it over 5 years ago?</p>\n<p>In this article and video I'm going to share how I'm building this type of project in 2025. The main change I've introduced since I documented my 2020 process is that now I'm using <a href=\"https://vite.dev/\">Vite</a> (French word that is pronounced \"veet\" and means \"quick\") instead of <code>create-react-app</code> to scaffold the React application, since the latter isn't maintained anymore.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: auto; margin-bottom: 15px;\"><div class=\"video-container\"></div></div>",
