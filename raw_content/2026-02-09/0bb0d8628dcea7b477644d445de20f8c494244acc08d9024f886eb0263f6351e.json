You are very welcome to improve this page via GitHub!\nIn this chapter we&rsquo;re going to build our first neural network and take it for a spin. Weirdly, this demonstration will likely simultaneously make you wonder &ldquo;is this all??&rdquo; and also impress you by what even this trivial stuff can do.\nThe first part of this chapter covers the theory, and shows no code.",
