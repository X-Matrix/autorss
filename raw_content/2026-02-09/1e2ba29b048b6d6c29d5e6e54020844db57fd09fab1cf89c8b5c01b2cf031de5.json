  "summary": "I&rsquo;ve seen some mediocre automated translations of my Dutch language resignation statement go round. To prevent any confusion, please find the story here in English:\nUntil today I was one of the three members of the board that checks warrants for the Dutch intelligence and security services. This board is called &ldquo;Toetsingscommissie Inzet Bevoegdheden&rdquo; or TIB.\nIf either of the civil or the military intelligence and security services of The Netherlands want to use their lawful intercept, SIGINT or hacking (&amp; some other) legal powers, they have to first convince their own jurists, then their ministry and finally the TIB.",
