  "summary": "A brief review of Stefan Zweig&rsquo;s 1942 book &ldquo;Die Welt von Gestern: Erinnerungen eines Europäers&rdquo;, which I read in the earlier English translation by Benjamin W. Huebsch and Helmut Ripperger (public domain copy). There is also a more recent translation by Anthea Bell, The World of Yesterday: Memoirs of a European. It too appears to be excellent.\n&nbsp;\nIt is not often that one feels the urge to review an 80 year old work, but it left such a huge impression on me that I simply must tell you about what I&rsquo;ve just read.",
