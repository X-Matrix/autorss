  "summary": "It is written that into each life some rain must fall, and currently a lot is falling on my family. We&rsquo;re getting very good care and lots of support, so please don&rsquo;t worry about us. I&rsquo;m told we&rsquo;ll get out of this.\nConsider this my &lsquo;out of office reply&rsquo; on many of my projects and activities. I&rsquo;m out of it for a bit. I know lots of people have seen me drop out of meetings and presentations, now you know why.",
