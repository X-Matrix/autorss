  "summary": "<p>So I’m making a thing and I want it to be styled different if the link’s been visited.</p>\n<p>Rather than build something myself in JavaScript, I figure I’ll just hook into the browser’s mechanism for tracking if a link’s been visited (a sensible approach, <a href=\"https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/browser-apis-as-sass/\">if I do say so myself</a>). </p>\n<p>Why write JavaScript when a little CSS will do? So I craft this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.entry</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-pseudo\">:has</span>(<span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">a</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-pseudo\">:visited</span>) {\n  <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">opacity</span>: .<span class=\"hljs-number\">5</span>;\n  <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">filter</span>: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">grayscale</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>But it doesn’t work.</p>\n<p><code>:has()</code> is relatively new, and I’ve been known to muff it, so it’s probably just a syntax issue.</p>\n<p>I start researching.</p>\n<p>Wouldn’t you know it? We can’t have nice things. <code>:visited</code> doesn’t always work like you’d expect because we (not me, mind you) exploited it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Selectors/Privacy_and_:visited\">Here’s MDN</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can style visited links, but there are limits to which styles you can use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While <code>:has()</code> is not mentioned specifically, other tricks like sibling selectors are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When using a sibling selector, such as <code>:visited + span</code>, the adjacent element (<code>span</code> in this example) is styled as though the link were unvisited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why? You guessed it. Security and privacy reasons.</p>\n<p>If it were not so, somebody could come along with a little JavaScript and uncover a user’s browsing history (imagine, for example, setting styles for visited and unvisited links, then using <code>window.getComputedStyle</code> and checking style computations).</p>\n<p>MDN says browsers tell little white lies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To preserve users' privacy, browsers lie to web applications under certain circumstances</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, from what I can tell, when I write <code>.entry:has(a:visited)</code> the browser is telling the engine that handles styling that all <code>.entry</code> items have never been <code>:visited</code> (even if they have been).</p>\n<p>So where does that leave me?</p>\n<p>Now I will abandon CSS and go use JavaScript for something only JavaScript can do.</p>\n<p>That’s a good reason for JS.</p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/browsers-white-lies/\">Email</a>\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>",
