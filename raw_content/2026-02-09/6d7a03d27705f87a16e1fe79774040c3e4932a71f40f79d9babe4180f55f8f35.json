  "summary": "Brief post on a somewhat vexing and irritating C++ problem I ran into some time ago. I hope that this page will help other people deal with this problem more quickly than I did.\nI&rsquo;ve long used std::basic_string&lt;uint8_t&gt;, an unsigned char string, for fiddling with bits. You could use a regular char string, but especially when doing cryptographic or sub-byte operations, it is more convenient to not have to deal with sign bits.",
