  "summary": "<p>It is upsettingly easy to work hard without being productive. <a href=\"https://theleanstartup.com/book\">The Lean Startup</a> includes a quote I really liked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;[People] feel that a good day is one in which they did their job well all day.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point being that this doesn&rsquo;t account for whether you are doing the right work. This is a really common trap to fall in to. I know I have often worked really hard on something and produced code I&rsquo;m very happy with, only to talk to my boss or the client and find that nobody else seems to be nearly as pleased with what I&rsquo;ve produced as I am.</p>",
