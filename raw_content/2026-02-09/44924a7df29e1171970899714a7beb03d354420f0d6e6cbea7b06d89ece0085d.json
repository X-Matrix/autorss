  "summary": "<p>People keep asking me If I use Generative AI tools for coding and what I think of them, so this is my effort to put my thoughts in writing, so that I can send people here instead of having to repeat myself every time I get the question.</p>\n<p>From the title you already know that this isn't a pro-AI blog post. But it isn't an anti-AI post either, at least I don't think it is. There are already plenty of articles by AI promoters and AI critics, so I don't feel there is a need for me to write one more of those. While I'm definitely not neutral on the subject, in this article I'm just going to share my personal experience with these tools, from a strictly technical point of view.</p>",
