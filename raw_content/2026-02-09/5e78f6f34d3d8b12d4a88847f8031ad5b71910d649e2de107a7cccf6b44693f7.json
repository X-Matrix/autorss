  "summary": "Linus Torvalds has long been one of my heroes. The invention of Linux &amp; the subsequent development of Git were technical and organizational miracles. You could fill a book simply by quoting examples of Linus dissecting technical problems to their components and making it obvious what should happen.\nHowever, over the past decade, Linus’ communication style has degraded from ‘Finnish style robust’ to needlessly hurtful screeds, tearing into people who did not deserve that.",
