  "summary": "<p>I'm not sure how I feel about webfonts. For now, I'm using IBM Plex serif, which looks pretty, sure. It loads pretty fast thanks to Cloudflare Fonts, which rewrites Google Fonts to be delivered from my own origin. But is it really necessary? Also, reading longer texts with a serif font is not everyone's cup of tea.</p>\n<p>A standard sans-serif <a href=\"https://systemfontstack.com/\">font stack</a> looks kinda ugly on Windows. Verdana still feels great (for example, on <a href=\"https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/\">Bearblog</a>), so maybe I'll try it later. </p>",
