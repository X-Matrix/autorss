He had, Trump said, a “heart\nthat couldn’t be stopped” with almost no health conditions to\nspeak of throughout his long life. “He had one problem,” Trump\nsaid. “At a certain age, about 86, 87, he started getting, what do\nthey call it?” He pointed to his forehead and looked to his press\nsecretary for the word that escaped him.</p>\n\n<p>“Alzheimer’s,” Leavitt said.</p>\n\n<p>“Like an Alzheimer’s thing,” Trump said. “Well, I don’t have it.”</p>\n\n<p>“Is it something you think about at all?” I asked.</p>\n\n<p>“No, I don’t think about it at all. You know why?” he said.\n“Because whatever it is, my attitude is whatever.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/27/whatever\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘Whatever’’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
