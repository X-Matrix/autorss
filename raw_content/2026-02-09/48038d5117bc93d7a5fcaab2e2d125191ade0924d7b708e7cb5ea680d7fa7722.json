  "summary": "This page collects links to raw and live sources on how well the planet, including its vital infrastructure, is doing right now, potentially visualised attractively. But the key thing is, we want Real Data, from the most direct sources.\nSources are expected to be realtime or at least updated frequently. Mere estimates of things based on questionable inputs are explicitly not welcome, no matter how pretty their output.\nPlease submit new links or fixes to @bert_hu_bert or bert@hubertnet.",
