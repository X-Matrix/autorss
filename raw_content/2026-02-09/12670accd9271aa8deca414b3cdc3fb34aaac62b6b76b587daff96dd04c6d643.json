  "summary": "This is a mostly verbatim transcript of my lecture at the TU Delft VvTP Physics symposium &ldquo;Security of Science&rdquo; held on the 20th of November.\nAudio version (scroll along the page to see the associated slides): Thank you so much for being here tonight. It&rsquo;s a great honor. I used to study here. I&rsquo;m a dropout. I never finished my studies, so I feel like I graduate tonight. This is a somewhat special presentation, it has footnotes and references, which you can browse later if you like what you saw.",
