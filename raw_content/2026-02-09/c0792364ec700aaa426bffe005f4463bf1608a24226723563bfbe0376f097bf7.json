  "summary": "Hi everyone,\nA brief note, I&rsquo;ve written a book, and the content is nearly done. You can read all about it here.\nThe first 90% of the project went well, but I need (well paid) help with the remaining 90% to turn it into a decent book.\nThis is a &lsquo;for profit&rsquo; book, but it will be given away for free to schools, universities and readers/students unable to afford it. So there is a bit of feel-good factor involved.",
