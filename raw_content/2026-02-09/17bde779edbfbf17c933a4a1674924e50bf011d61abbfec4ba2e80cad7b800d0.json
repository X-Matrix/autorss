  "summary": "In part 5 we discussed smart pointers, placement new and the powerful move constructor. As you may have gathered by now, parts 1 through 5 were a pitch to sell modern C++ to existing C specialists. To do so, I tried to show the best and most immediately useful parts of C++.\nNote: part 1 is here.\nAs noted earlier, no language is perfect, and not all features of C++ are as good or as spectacular.",
