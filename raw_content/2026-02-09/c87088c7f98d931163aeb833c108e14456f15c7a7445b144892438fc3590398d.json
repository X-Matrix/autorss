  "summary": "I used AI with success 5 minutes ago.\n<br />\n<br />Just five minutes ago, I was writing a piece of software and relied on AI for assistance. Yet, here I am, starting this blog post by telling you that artificial intelligence, so far, has proven somewhat useless. How can I make such a statement if AI was just so helpful a moment ago? Actually, there's no contradiction here if we clarify exactly what we mean.\n<br />\n<br />Here’s the thing: at this very moment, artificial intelligence can support me significantly. If I'm struggling with complicated code or need to understand an advanced scientific paper on math, I can turn to AI for clarity. It can help me generate an image for a project, make a translation, clean my YouTube transcript. Clearly, it’s practical and beneficial in these everyday tasks.\n<br />\n<br />However, except for rare, groundbreaking examples like AlphaFold — Google's AI that significantly advanced our understanding of protein folding — AI has yet to genuinely push forward human knowledge in a fundamental way. Aside from these few exceptional results, AI hasn’t (obviously) yet matched the capabilities of the very best human minds. If an AI system were at the same level as the brightest humans (and not better than that:  it's not needed for a first humanity jump) we could deploy millions of such systems to accelerate research dramatically, transforming progress expected to take centuries into developments happening within decades, or decades into years.\n<br />\n<br />Yet, if artificial intelligence remains stuck at its current level of development indefinitely (even if with small incremental improvements, enough to fire many translators, programmers, drivers, actors, ...), perhaps it might have been better not to have it at all. I mentioned this during a conference here in Sicily. The thought hadn't crossed my mind until I was asked on stage. While I was formulating my reply I asked myself: if we knew AI would only yield minor incremental improvements, would it be worth enduring the social upheaval caused by job losses and other stresses? Possibly not. Technologies should serve humanity by enabling greater cultural development, reducing suffering, and allowing us to achieve what otherwise would be impossible. The current level of AI, while helpful, doesn't fully achieve that.\n<br />\n<br />That's why investing in AI is like making a bet. I advocate for further investment and continued progress — not necessarily because of what AI can currently do, but because of what it might become in the future. The advancements we see today often exceed our expectations, hinting at even greater unforeseen breakthroughs tomorrow.\n<br />\n<br />For us proponents of AI, the argument shouldn't hinge solely on AI’s current abilities but rather on its potential. Five years from now, AI could offer revolutionary advancements in medicine, saving countless lives. In 10 to 20 years, it might significantly contribute to environmental solutions, clarifying complex issues or providing effective methods to mitigate climate change.\n<br />\n<br />Even a modest breakthrough might clarify that climate change dynamics, while serious, can be controlled more effectively than we currently believe, or don't need control as they are not as dramatic as we may think, or that decisive action can resolve the problem within a manageable timeframe. The real stakes are in the future, not the present. To focus exclusively on today's AI capabilities limits our perspective and makes it challenging to convince skeptics. But if future developments meet or exceed expectations, the temporary social problems arising today would be a small price to pay for the immense benefits.\n<br />\n<br />However, we must be cautious. Existential risks (AI potentially becoming a catastrophic threat) are real, though minimal. We must remain vigilant and prepared. Social challenges, too, require thoughtful attention from governments and societies.\n<br />\n<br />Ultimately, I believe we must take the risk, persist, and explore what's beyond the frontier, because if AI fulfills even some of its enormous potential, it could redefine our capabilities, reshape society, and completely transform humanity’s future: for the better.\n<br />\n<br />Now, let me go back to my LLM for free and fast code review.\n<a href=\"http://antirez.com/news/148\">Comments</a>",
