For those that weren&rsquo;t - this was a critical security error that allowed attackers to run any code they wanted on your servers. The root cause was a logging library, Log4J, that is used by most projects that are writting in Java.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s usually used to write code something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>log.info(&quot;Process completed successfully&quot;);</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which will then appear in your logs, allowing you to track your application&rsquo;s behaviour. Pretty innocuous stuff.</p>",
