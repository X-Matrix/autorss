My talk isn't close to done yet, which is why this newsletter is both late and short. </p>\n<h1>Solving LinkedIn Queens in SMT</h1>\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://codingnest.com/modern-sat-solvers-fast-neat-underused-part-1-of-n/\" target=\"_blank\">Modern SAT solvers: fast, neat and underused</a> claims that SAT solvers<sup id=\"fnref:SAT\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:SAT\">1</a></sup> are \"criminally underused by the industry\". A while back on the newsletter I asked \"why\": how come they're so powerful and yet nobody uses them? Many experts responded saying the reason is that encoding SAT kinda sucked and they rather prefer using tools that compile to SAT. </p>\n<p>I was reminded of this when I read <a href=\"https://ryanberger.me/posts/queens/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Berger's post</a> on solving “LinkedIn Queens” as a SAT problem. </p>\n<p>A quick overview of Queens. You’re presented with an NxN grid divided into N regions, and have to place N queens so that there is exactly one queen in each row, column, and region. While queens can be on the same diagonal, they <em>cannot</em> be adjacently diagonal.</p>\n<p>(Important note: Linkedin “Queens” is a variation on the puzzle game <a href=\"https://starbattle.puzzlebaron.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Star Battle</a>, which is the same except the number of stars you place in each row/column/region varies per puzzle, and is usually two. This is also why 'queens' don’t capture like chess queens.)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"An image of a solved queens board. Copied from https://ryanberger.me/posts/queens\" class=\"newsletter-image\" src=\"https://assets.buttondown.email/images/96f6f923-331f-424d-8641-fe6753e1c2ca.png?w=960&amp;fit=max\" /></p>\n<p>Ryan solved this by writing Queens as a SAT problem, expressing properties like \"there is exactly one queen in row 3\" as a large number of boolean clauses. <a href=\"https://ryanberger.me/posts/queens/\" target=\"_blank\">Go read his post, it's pretty cool</a>. What leapt out to me was that he used <a href=\"https://cvc5.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">CVC5</a>, an <strong>SMT</strong> solver.<sup id=\"fnref:SMT\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:SMT\">2</a></sup> SMT solvers are \"higher-level\" than SAT, capable of handling more data types than just boolean variables. It's a lot easier to solve the problem at the SMT level than at the SAT level. To show this, I whipped up a short demo of solving the same problem in <a href=\"https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki\" target=\"_blank\">Z3</a> (via the <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/\" target=\"_blank\">Python API</a>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/hwayne/c5de7bc52e733995311236666bedecd3\" target=\"_blank\">Full code here</a>, which you can compare to Ryan's SAT solution <a href=\"https://github.com/ryan-berger/queens/blob/master/main.py\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I didn't do a whole lot of cleanup on it (again, time crunch!), but short explanation below.</p>\n<h3>The code</h3>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">z3</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"c1\"># type: ignore</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">itertools</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">combinations</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">chain</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">product</span>\n<span class=\"n\">solver</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">Solver</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"n\">size</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">9</span> <span class=\"c1\"># N</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Initial setup and modules. <code>size</code> is the number of rows/columns/regions in the board, which I'll call <code>N</code> below.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\"># queens[n] = col of queen on row n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># by construction, not on same row</span>\n<span class=\"n\">queens</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">IntVector</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'q'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">size</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> \n</code></pre></div>\n<p>SAT represents the queen positions via N² booleans: <code>q_00</code> means that a Queen is on row 0 and column 0, <code>!q_05</code> means a queen <em>isn't</em> on row 0 col 5, etc. In SMT we can instead encode it as N integers: <code>q_0 = 5</code> means that the queen on row 0 is positioned at column 5. This immediately enforces one class of constraints for us: we don't need any constraints saying \"exactly one queen per row\", because that's embedded in the definition of <code>queens</code>!</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, using 0-based indexing for the board was a mistake on my part, it makes correctly encoding the regions later really painful.)</p>\n<p>To actually make the variables <code>[q_0, q_1, …]</code>, we use the Z3 affordance <code>IntVector(str, n)</code> for making <code>n</code> variables at once.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">solver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">add</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">And</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;=</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"n\">size</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">queens</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># not on same column</span>\n<span class=\"n\">solver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Distinct</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">queens</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>First we constrain all the integers to <code>[0, N)</code>, then use the <em>incredibly</em> handy <code>Distinct</code> constraint to force all the integers to have different values. This guarantees at most one queen per column, which by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle\" target=\"_blank\">pigeonhole principle</a> means there is exactly one queen per column.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\"># not diagonally adjacent</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">size</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">q1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">q2</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">queens</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">queens</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">solver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Abs</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">q1</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"n\">q2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">!=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>One of the rules is that queens can't be adjacent. We already know that they can't be horizontally or vertically adjacent via other constraints, which leaves the diagonals. We only need to add constraints that, for each queen, there is no queen in the lower-left or lower-right corner, aka <code>q_3 != q_2 ± 1</code>. We don't need to check the top corners because if <code>q_1</code> is in the upper-left corner of <code>q_2</code>, then <code>q_2</code> is in the lower-right corner of <code>q_1</code>!</p>\n<p>That covers everything except the \"one queen per region\" constraint. But the regions are the tricky part, which we should expect because we vary the difficulty of queens games by varying the regions.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">regions</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"s2\">\"purple\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">6</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">7</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n                   <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">6</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">7</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n                   <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)],</span>\n        <span class=\"s2\">\"red\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">6</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">6</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">7</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">7</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">8</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">),],</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\"># you get the picture</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Some checking code left out, see below</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The region has to be manually coded in, which is a huge pain.</p>\n<p>(In the link, some validation code follows. Since it breaks up explaining the model I put it in the next section.)</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">r</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">regions</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">values</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">solver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Or</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">queens</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">row</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"n\">col</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">row</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">col</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">r</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Finally we have the region constraint. The easiest way I found to say \"there is exactly one queen in each region\" is to say \"there is a queen in region 1 and a queen in region 2 and a queen in region 3\" etc.\" Then to say \"there is a queen in region <code>purple</code>\" I wrote \"<code>q_0 = 0</code> OR <code>q_0 = 1</code> OR … OR <code>q_1 = 0</code> etc.\" </p>\n<p>Why iterate over every position in the region instead of doing something like <code>(0, q[0]) in r</code>? I tried that but it's not an expression that Z3 supports.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">solver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">check</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"n\">sat</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">solver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">model</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">([(</span><span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">])</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">l</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">queens</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Finally, we solve and print the positions.

I didn't benchmark the solution times, but I imagine it's considerably slower than a raw SAT solver. <a href=\"https://github.com/audemard/glucose\" target=\"_blank\">Glucose</a> is really, really fast.</p>\n<p>But even so, solving the problem with SMT was a lot <em>easier</em> than solving it with SAT. That satisfies me as an explanation for why people prefer it to SAT.</p>\n<h3>Sanity checks</h3>\n<p>One bit I glossed over earlier was the sanity checking code. I <em>knew for sure</em> that I was going to make a mistake encoding the <code>region</code>, and the solver wasn't going to provide useful information abut what I did wrong.
