  "summary": "Brief post, in response to the many many many technical people that propose to print their own mRNA vaccines &ldquo;now that the source is out there&rdquo;.\nI&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time individually explaining why this is unlikely to happen any time soon, and I thought it a good idea to explain it here as well.\nMountains of details on how the vaccines are actually produced can be found on this awesome page by Jonas Neubert and Cornelia Scheitz.",
