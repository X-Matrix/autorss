  "summary": "This article is part of a series on (European) innovation and capabilities.\nHi everyone,\nThis is a transcript of my presentation over at the European Microwave Week 2020, actually held in 2021. You can find the video here and the slides here. I&rsquo;d like to thank Frank van Vliet, general chair of the EMW, for inviting me to do this talk.\nThe words have only been edited lightly - it is still presentation style, so here and there the sentences are not written like how they&rsquo;d be in a more formal piece of work.",
