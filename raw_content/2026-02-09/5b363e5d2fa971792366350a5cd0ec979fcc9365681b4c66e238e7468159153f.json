This way, if you put an AirTag inside your\nbags, the airline can better help you find them in the event they\nare lost or delayed at the airport. [...] Below, we have listed\nmost of the airlines that support the feature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/apple-introduces-new-airtag-with-expanded-range-and-improved-findability/\">Apple’s announcement</a> claims that 36 airlines support it today, and 15 more are coming soon.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/26/airlines-airtags\" title=\"Permanent link to ‘Airlines That Support Shared Item Location for Luggage With AirTags’\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
