  "summary": "We are destroying software by no longer taking complexity into account when adding features or optimizing some dimension.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software with complex build systems.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software with an absurd chain of dependencies, making everything bloated and fragile.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software telling new programmers: “Don’t reinvent the wheel!”. But, reinventing the wheel is how you learn how things work, and is the first step to make new, different wheels.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software by no longer caring about backward APIs compatibility.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software pushing for rewrites of things that work.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software by jumping on every new language, paradigm, and framework.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software by always underestimating how hard it is to work with existing complex libraries VS creating our stuff.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software by always thinking that the de-facto standard for XYZ is better than what we can do, tailored specifically for our use case.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software claiming that code comments are useless.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software mistaking it for a purely engineering discipline.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software by making systems that no longer scale down: simple things should be simple to accomplish, in any system.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software trying to produce code as fast as possible, not as well designed as possible.\n<br />\n<br />We are destroying software, and what will be left will no longer give us the joy of hacking.\n<a href=\"http://antirez.com/news/145\">Comments</a>",
