  "summary": "Nothing on this page is factually controversial. However, many things in this post make for uncomfortable reading. And, climate discourse is now so politicized that many factual statements are taken as dog whistles. For example, in what follows I will state that climate has always been changing, and has in fact never been stable for very long.\nThis is 100% true, but people interpret this as if the writer means that our current climate change is not caused by human beings, or is nothing to worry about.",
