  "summary": "TLDR; You can use semihosting on any ARM CPU to send and receive data in a few lines of code.\nClick here to see an example implementation on a 10p &ldquo;disposable&rdquo; microcontroller.\nContext There are many ways to debug embedded projects. For high speed stuff, you might toggle a pin at the beginning and end of a subroutine. On a more advanced project, you might have structured logging to a file-system.",
