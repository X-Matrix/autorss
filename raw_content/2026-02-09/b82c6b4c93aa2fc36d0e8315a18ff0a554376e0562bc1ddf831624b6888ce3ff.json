  "summary": "<p>I don't envy beginners trying to get into web development today.</p>\n<p>I haven't been doing any frontend web development for more than a decade. Today I was trying to do a simple thing: get a JS markdown editor to work in the browser. Found this beautiful looking library called <a href=\"https://tiptap.dev/\">Tiptap</a>. This <a href=\"https://tiptap.dev/docs/examples/basics/markdown-shortcuts\">example</a> seems great! Let's try to integrate it.</p>\n<p>What I naively expected:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">src</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;some_cdn_url.js&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"language-handlebars\"><span class=\"language-xml\">\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">id</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;editor&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span></span></span>\n</code></pre><p>What happened:</p>\n<p>There's a <a href=\"https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/getting-started/install/vanilla-javascript\">documentation page</a> for using TipTap with &quot;vanilla javascript&quot;. Sounds good! It starts with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-console\">npm install @tiptap/core @tiptap/pm @tiptap/starter-kit\n</code></pre><p>Wait, what? <code>npm</code> is a Node package manager, right? Then it goes to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> { <span class=\"hljs-title class_\">Editor</span> } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;@tiptap/core&#x27;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"hljs-title class_\">StarterKit</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;@tiptap/starter-kit&#x27;</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"hljs-title class_\">Editor</span>({\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">element</span>: <span class=\"hljs-variable language_\">document</span>.<span class=\"hljs-title function_\">querySelector</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;.element&#x27;</span>),\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">extensions</span>: [<span class=\"hljs-title class_\">StarterKit</span>],\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">content</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;&lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;&#x27;</span>,\n})\n</code></pre><p>Hmm... I guess this is Vanilla JS, since <code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;</code> should be <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/es6-module\">working</a> in latest browsers. But... what? Do web developers today mean &quot;Node&quot; when they say &quot;Vanilla JavaScript&quot;? </p>\n<p>(I also have seen people saying &quot;without a framework&quot; when using plain React... yeah.) </p>\n<p>There's a confusing <a href=\"https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/issues/2486\">github thread</a> with people seemingly not understanding each other, and a strong &quot;kids nowadays&quot; vibes from one of the participants. Someone did produce a working example of truly Vanilla JS use <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/throbbing-smoke-now37q?file=%2Findex.html%3A8%2C5-8%2C27\">here</a>. It works! But wait again... There's like 50 lines of JS to make the &quot;bold&quot; button work. </p>\n<p>Anyway, turns out TipTap does not support Markdown output natively. So, I've looked around more.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor\">SimpleMDE</a> looks alright, but seems like the development stopped about 8 years ago. Based on Codemirror.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor\">EasyMDE</a> is a fork of SimpleMDE. Lots of features, and looks pretty good.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/basecamp/trix\">Trix</a> is cool, and I've used it in the past for another project, but it's a rich-text editor without any markdown support. From the creators or Rails. <a href=\"https://x.com/dhh/status/1808485490573635714\">DHH said</a> they will soon release their new markdown editor called House, I'm looking forward to trying it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prosemirror.net/\">Prosemirror</a> is also designed primarily for rich text, but is very flexible. It's more of a framework for building editors.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.remirror.io/\">Remirror</a> is based on Prosemirror, but can only be used with React.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bytemd.js.org/playground/\">ByteMD</a> has some nice features and integrations.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://editorjs.io/\">EditorJS</a> is a block-based editor (similar to Notion), but I for some reason really dislike this concept.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mdxeditor.dev/\">MDXEditor</a> has some strange design decisions. For example, fenced code blocks don't seem to work by default.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/markdown.html\">CKEditor</a> has markdown support, but seems a bit too complicated for my use case.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ui.toast.com/tui-editor\">Toast</a> is alright.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://milkdown.dev/\">Milkdown</a> is not meant to be used outside of frameworks like React or Vue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's a bunch more, but most of them have one or more deal-breakers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funky WYSIWYG</li>\n<li>React or other framework required</li>\n<li>Complex structure, difficult to customize without learning all the layers and architecture</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For now, I settled on using Codemirror. SimpleMDE and EasyMDE are good wrappers on top of Codemirror, but Codemirror is so straight-forward to work with that I'd rather write my own code to do things like inserting links, bold/italic triggers, image uploads, etc. </p>\n<p>I'm writing this post in the new editor. Here's a cat portrait I took in Georgia a few years ago (just to test the image uploading!):</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.exotext.com/1/Q2jsB1s0muyEuPKwFwatc.jpg\" /></p>",
