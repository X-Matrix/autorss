  "summary": "Last year I wrote a post listing what I had been doing in 2018, because it turned out it was a lot, so much that it was useful to summarise it somewhat.\nThis year there is less to report, but people have wondered what I&rsquo;ve been up to. And I&rsquo;ve learned that if you leave room for speculation about your intentions, wrong answers tend to come up.\nThis (professional) year for me mostly consisted of two things: DNS over HTTPS and Galileo.",
