  "summary": "Recently I revamped my home internet, and (hopefully) temporarily ended up with a modem that needs to be power cycled from time to time. We&rsquo;re working on getting it fixed, but in the meantime I needed a solution for automated power cycling.\nThere are various ways to turn the power off or on from a Linux computer, and some of these are very karmic. You can get a zigbee USB stick and ditto power plugs, and I am sure this is a lot of fun.",
