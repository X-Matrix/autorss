Over three days they drove a single Codex CLI agent to build 20,000 lines of Rust that successfully renders HTML+CSS with no Rust crate dependencies at all - though it does (reasonably) use Windows, macOS and Linux system frameworks for image and text rendering.</p>\n<p>I installed the <a href=\"https://github.com/embedding-shapes/one-agent-one-browser/releases/tag/0.1.0\">1MB macOS binary release</a> and ran it against my blog:</p>\n<pre><code>chmod 755 ~/Downloads/one-agent-one-browser-macOS-ARM64 \n~/Downloads/one-agent-one-browser-macOS-ARM64 https://simonwillison.net/\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's the result:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"My blog rendered in a window. Everything is in the right place, the CSS gradients look good, the feed subscribe SVG icon is rendered correctly but there's a missing PNG image.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/one-agent-simonwillison.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>It even rendered my SVG feed subscription icon! A PNG image is missing from the page, which looks like an intermittent bug (there's code to render PNGs).</p>\n<p>The code is pretty readable too - here's <a href=\"https://github.com/embedding-shapes/one-agent-one-browser/blob/0.1.0/src/layout/flex.rs\">the flexbox implementation</a>.</p>\n<p>I had thought that \"build a web browser\" was the ideal prompt to really stretch the capabilities of coding agents - and that it would take sophisticated multi-agent harnesses (as seen in the Cursor project) and millions of lines of code to achieve.</p>\n<p>Turns out one agent driven by a talented engineer, three days and 20,000 lines of Rust is enough to get a very solid basic renderer working!</p>\n<p>I'm going to upgrade my <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/#3-years-someone-will-build-a-new-browser-using-mainly-ai-assisted-coding-and-it-won-t-even-be-a-surprise\">prediction for 2029</a>: I think we're going to get a <em>production-grade</em> web browser built by a small team using AI assistance by then.\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46779522\">Show Hacker News</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/browsers\">browsers</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/predictions\">predictions</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/rust\">rust</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/codex-cli\">codex-cli</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/browser-challenge\">browser-challenge</a></p>",
