  "summary": "<blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately since Elon shut down the Twitter APIs, the below method no longer works. Still, it was fun while it lasted, eh?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gephi is a piece of software for visualising graph networks. It&rsquo;s a powerful tool, and to use it fully requires significant domain knowledge that I don&rsquo;t possess, but fortunately it&rsquo;s still fascinating to play around with as an amateur!</p>\n<p>As a techie, to me the obvious networks to graph are those created by the big Social Networks - YouTube, Facebook, etc. It&rsquo;s not hugely surprising to find that mostly these graphs mostly aren&rsquo;t available for querying, but excitingly there is a plugin that allows you to stream in live data from Twitter.</p>",
