  "summary": "<p>I recently spoke to a developer who tried blogging but gave up because nobody was reading his posts. I checked out his blog, and it was immediately obvious why he didn&rsquo;t have any readers.</p>\n<p>The developer had interesting insights, but he made so many mistakes in presenting his ideas that he was driving everyone away. The tragedy was that these errors were easy to fix. Once you learn to recognize them, they feel obvious, but some bloggers make these mistakes for years.</p>",
