  "summary": "This article is part of a series on (European) innovation and capabilities.\nRecently I participated in a very useful panel that aimed to demystify European digital sovereignty. Even though we spoke for more than an hour (video), we obviously were not able to fix all of Europe&rsquo;s sovereignty problems!\nThe event was organized by Scaleway (previously Online SAS or Online.net), a 100% subsidiary of what I think is Europe&rsquo;s most innovative telecommunications company, Iliad.",
