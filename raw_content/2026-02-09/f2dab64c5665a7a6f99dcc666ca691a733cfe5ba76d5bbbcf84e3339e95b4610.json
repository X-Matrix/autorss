  "summary": "On the 11th of October, Dutch parliament organized a hearing on the EU &ldquo;Chatcontrol&rdquo; proposal, with a focus on client side scanning. Dutch parliament had earlier passed two motions calling on the Dutch government not to support this proposal, but our government has declared it will ignore those motions. This hearing was timely because next week, or even this Friday, EU member states vote on how to proceed with this terrible proposal (Lawfare review from a US perspective).",
