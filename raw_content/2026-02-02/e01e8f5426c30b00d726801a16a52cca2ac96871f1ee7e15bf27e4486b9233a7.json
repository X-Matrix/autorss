  "summary": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/\">Introducing the Codex app</a></strong></p>\nOpenAI just released a new macOS app for their Codex coding agent. I've had a few days of preview access - it's a solid app that provides a nice UI over the capabilities of the Codex CLI agent and adds some interesting new features, most notably first-class support for <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills\">Skills</a>, and <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/automations\">Automations</a> for running scheduled tasks.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of a macOS desktop application with a dark sidebar and light main content area. Left sidebar shows navigation items &quot;New thread&quot;, &quot;Automations&quot;, &quot;Skills&quot;, and a &quot;Threads&quot; section containing two project folders: &quot;local-codex-scratch&quot; with tasks &quot;Reply to greeting task 2h&quot; and &quot;List Codex.app contents 3h&quot;, and &quot;shot-scraper&quot; with tasks &quot;Validate tests on dependency... 3h&quot;, &quot;Document shot-scraper CLI usage 18h&quot; (highlighted), and &quot;Run this: uv run pytest -x 1d&quot;. Bottom left shows &quot;Personal&quot;. Top bar displays &quot;Document shot-scraper CLI usage shot-scraper&quot; with &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Commit&quot; dropdown buttons. Main content shows a conversation: user message &quot;Build a skill describing how to use the shot-scraper CLI tool&quot; followed by assistant responses: &quot;I'll use the skill-creator skill, scan the repo for existing shot-scraper docs/commands, then draft a concise skill in this workspace and sanity-check it.&quot; then &quot;I've confirmed the skill-creator scripts exist. Next I'll inspect the CLI entrypoint and docs, then scaffold a skill under skills/ in this repo.&quot; then &quot;I've scaffolded skills/shot-scraper-cli/. I'll now replace the template SKILL.md with a task-focused skill and add a compact CLI reference under references/.&quot; then &quot;I'll run the skill packager/validator next to ensure the new skill structure is valid.&quot; then &quot;Done — I created and packaged the skill. Key outputs: • Skill definition: SKILL.md • Compact reference: cli-reference.md • Packaged skill: shot-scraper-cli.skill&quot;. Bottom shows input field with placeholder &quot;Ask for follow-up changes&quot;, &quot;+ Custom Medium&quot; dropdown, and &quot;Local&quot; and &quot;main&quot; branch indicators.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/codex-app.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The app is built with Electron and Node.js. Automations track their state in a SQLite database - here's what that looks like if you explore it with <code>uvx datasette ~/.codex/sqlite/codex-dev.db</code>:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Database schema documentation on light gray background showing three tables: &quot;automation_runs&quot; (teal underlined link) with italic columns &quot;thread_id, automation_id, status, read_at, thread_title, source_cwd, inbox_title, inbox_summary, created_at, updated_at, archived_user_message, archived_assistant_message, archived_reason&quot; and &quot;1 row&quot;; &quot;automations&quot; (teal underlined link) with italic columns &quot;id, name, prompt, status, next_run_at, last_run_at, cwds, rrule, created_at, updated_at&quot; and &quot;1 row&quot;; &quot;inbox_items&quot; (teal underlined link) with italic columns &quot;id, title, description, thread_id, read_at, created_at&quot; and &quot;0 rows&quot;.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/codex-dev-sqlite.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Here’s an interactive copy of that database <a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fsimonw%2F274c4ecfaf959890011810e6881864fe%2Fraw%2F51fdf25c9426b76e9693ccc0d9254f64ceeef819%2Fcodex-dev.db#/codex-dev\">in Datasette Lite</a>.</p>\n<p>The announcement gives us a hint at some usage numbers for Codex overall - the holiday spike is notable:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since the launch of GPT‑5.2-Codex in mid-December, overall Codex usage has doubled, and in the past month, more than a million developers have used Codex.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Automations are currently restricted in that they can only run when your laptop is powered on. OpenAI promise that cloud-based automations are coming soon, which will resolve this limitation.</p>\n<p>They chose Electron so they could target other operating systems in the future, with Windows “<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46859054#46859673\">coming very soon</a>”. OpenAI’s Alexander Embiricos noted <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46859054#46859693\">on the Hacker News thread</a> that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it's taking us some time to get really solid sandboxing working on Windows, where there are fewer OS-level primitives for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like Claude Code, Codex is really a general agent harness disguised as a tool for programmers. OpenAI acknowledge that here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Codex is built on a simple premise: everything is controlled by code. The better an agent is at reasoning about and producing code, the more capable it becomes across all forms of technical and knowledge work. [...] We’ve focused on making Codex the best coding agent, which has also laid the foundation for it to become a strong agent for a broad range of knowledge work tasks that extend beyond writing code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Claude Code had to <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/12/claude-cowork/\">rebrand to Cowork</a> to better cover the general knowledge work case. OpenAI can probably get away with keeping the Codex name for both.</p>\n<p>OpenAI have made Codex available to free and <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/16/chatgpt-ads/\">Go</a> plans for \"a limited time\" (update: Sam Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2018437537103269909\">says two months</a>) during which they are also doubling the rate limits for paying users.\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/sandboxing\">sandboxing</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/sqlite\">sqlite</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasette\">datasette</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/electron\">electron</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/openai\">openai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-agents\">ai-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/codex-cli\">codex-cli</a></p>",
