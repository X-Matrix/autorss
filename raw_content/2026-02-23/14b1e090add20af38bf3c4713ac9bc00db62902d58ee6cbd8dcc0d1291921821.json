  "summary": "Climate change impacts a broad spectrum of human resources and activities, necessitating the use of climate models to project long-term effects and inform mitigation and adaptation strategies. These models generate multiple datasets by running simulations across various scenarios and configurations, thereby covering a range of potential future outcomes. Currently, researchers rely on traditional search interfaces and APIs to retrieve such datasets, often piecing together information from metadata and community vocabularies. The Climate Change Knowledge Graph is designed to address these challenges by integrating diverse data sources related to climate simulations into a coherent and interoperable knowledge graph. This innovative resource allows for executing complex queries involving climate models, simulations, variables, spatio-temporal domains, and granularities. Developed with input from domain experts, the knowledge graph and its underlying ontology are published with open access license and provide a comprehensive framework that enhances the exploration of climate data, facilitating more informed decision-making in addressing climate change issues.",
