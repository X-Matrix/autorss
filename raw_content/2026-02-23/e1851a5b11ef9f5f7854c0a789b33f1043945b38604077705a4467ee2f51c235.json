  "summary": "We present AgentOptics, an agentic AI framework for high-fidelity, autonomous optical system control built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). AgentOptics interprets natural language tasks and executes protocol-compliant actions on heterogeneous optical devices through a structured tool abstraction layer. We implement 64 standardized MCP tools across 8 representative optical devices and construct a 410-task benchmark to evaluate request understanding, role-aware responses, multi-step coordination, robustness to linguistic variation, and error handling. We assess two deployment configurations--commercial online LLMs and locally hosted open-source LLMs--and compare them with LLM-based code generation baselines. AgentOptics achieves 87.7%--99.0% average task success rates, significantly outperforming code-generation approaches, which reach up to 50% success. We further demonstrate broader applicability through five case studies extending beyond device-level control to system orchestration, monitoring, and closed-loop optimization. These include DWDM link provisioning and coordinated monitoring of coherent 400 GbE and analog radio-over-fiber (ARoF) channels; autonomous characterization and bias optimization of a wideband ARoF link carrying 5G fronthaul traffic; multi-span channel provisioning with launch power optimization; closed-loop fiber polarization stabilization; and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)-based fiber monitoring with LLM-assisted event detection. These results establish AgentOptics as a scalable, robust paradigm for autonomous control and orchestration of heterogeneous optical systems.",
