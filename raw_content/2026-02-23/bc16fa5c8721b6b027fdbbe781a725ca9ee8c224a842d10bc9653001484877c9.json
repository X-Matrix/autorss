  "summary": "Solving safety-critical control problem has widely adopted the Control Barrier Function (CBF) method. However, the existence of a CBF is only a sufficient condition for system safety. The recently proposed Taylor-Lagrange Control (TLC) method addresses this limitation, but is vulnerable to the feasibility preservation problem (e.g., inter-sampling effect). In this paper, we propose a robust TLC (rTLC) method to address the feasibility preservation problem. Specifically, the rTLC method expands the safety function at an order higher than the relative degree of the function using Taylor's expansion with Lagrange remainder, which allows the control to explicitly show up at the current time instead of the future time in the TLC method. The rTLC method naturally addresses the feasibility preservation problem with only one hyper-parameter (the discretization time interval size during implementation), which is much less than its counterparts. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed rTLC method through an adaptive cruise control problem, and compare it with existing safety-critical control methods.",
