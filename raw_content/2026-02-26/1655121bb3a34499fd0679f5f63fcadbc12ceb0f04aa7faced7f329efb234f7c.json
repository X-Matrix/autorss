  "summary": "In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, hindering calm decision-making. This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.",
