  "summary": "The promise of general-purpose agents - systems that perform tasks in unfamiliar environments without domain-specific engineering - remains largely unrealized. Existing agents are predominantly specialized, and while emerging implementations like OpenAI SDK Agent and Claude Code hint at broader capabilities, no systematic evaluation of their general performance has been pursued. Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents. This paper frames general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective. We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. We benchmark five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard. Our experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning. We release our evaluation protocol, framework, and leaderboard to establish a foundation for systematic research on general-purpose agents.",
