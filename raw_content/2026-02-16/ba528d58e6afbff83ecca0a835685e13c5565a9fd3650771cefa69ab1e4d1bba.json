  "summary": "Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, relying on sparse rewards makes this process highly sample-inefficient, as models must navigate vast search spaces with minimal feedback. While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities. On OpenMathReasoning dataset, Goldilocks data sampling improves the performance of models trained with standard GRPO under the same compute budget.",
